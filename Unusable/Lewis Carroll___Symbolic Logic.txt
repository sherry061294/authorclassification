<s> pg-viii PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION </s>
<s> The chief alterations, since the First Edition, have been made in the Chapter on 'Classification' (pp </s>
<s> 2, 3) and the Book on 'Propositions' (pp </s>
<s> 10 to 19) </s>
<s> The chief additions have been the questions on words and phrases, added to the Examination-Papers at p </s>
<s> 94, and the Notes inserted at pp </s>
<s> 164, 194 </s>
<s> In Book I, Chapter II, I have adopted a new definition of 'Classification', which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a 'Class,' and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase 'a Set of Things' </s>
<s> In the Chapter on 'Propositions of Existence' I have adopted a new 'normal form,' in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or denied, is regarded as the _Predicate_, instead of the _Subject_, of the Proposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the other form </s>
<s> These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every Tree of Knowledge, and they are _far_ more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches </s>
<s> For example, the difficulties of the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child's play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight Line </s>
<s> And, in the present work, the difficulties of the "5 Liars" Problem, at p </s>
<s> 192, are "trifles, light as air," compared with the bewildering question "What is a Thing" </s>
<s> In the Chapter on 'Propositions of Relation' I have inserted a new Section, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with "All," is a _Double_ Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition is to be understood as implying the actual _existence_ of its Subject) </s>
<s> This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its _proper_ place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it </s>
<s> pg-ix In the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of the Readers of the first three Editions </s>
<s> Some of the Premisses were so worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ </s>
<s> named in the Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ </s>
<s> was only a portion </s>
<s> In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of its _other_ portion </s>
<s> Thus, in Ex </s>
<s> 15, the Univ </s>
<s> was stated to be "ducks in this village," and the third Premiss was "Mrs Bond has no gray ducks," i.e </s>
<s> "No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs Bond" </s>
<s> Here the Terms are _not_ Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class "ducks," of which the Univ </s>
<s> is only a portion: and it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of "ducks" is thereby asserted of "ducks in this village" </s>
<s> and should treat this Premiss as if it were "Mrs Bond has no gray ducks in this village," and should ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the _other_ portion of the Class "ducks," viz </s>
<s> "Mrs Bond has no gray ducks _out of_ this village" </s>
<s> In the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the "Five Liars" </s>
<s> My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as being its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for one another </s>
<s> It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of _substance_ in all this shadowy host----that, as the procession of phantoms glides before us, there is not _one_ that we can pounce upon, and say "_Here_ is a Proposition that _must_ be either true or false"!----that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been bidden----and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island, whose inhabitants "earned a precarious living by taking in each others' washing" </s>
<s> By simply translating "telling 2 Truths" into "taking _both_ of 2 condiments (salt and mustard)," "telling 2 Lies" into "taking _neither_ of them" and "telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)" into "taking only _one_ condiment (it is not specified _which_)," I have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the very same _Data_ as were furnished by the Problem of the "Five Liars" </s>
<s> pg-x The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as "Eliminands" and "Retinends", perhaps hardly need any apology: they were indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first time, viz </s>
<s> "Soriteses", will, I fear, be condemned as "bad English", unless I say a word in its defence </s>
<s> We have _three_ singular nouns, in English, of plural _form_, "series", "species", and "Sorites": in all three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case of "series" by coining the plural "serieses", which has already found its way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely "following suit", in using the new plural "Soriteses" </s>
<s> In conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to study _Formal_ Logic, with a view to being able to answer Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of _Symbolic_ Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of _testing_ the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries </s>
<s> This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own little book, _The Game of Logic_, published in 1886, a very incomplete performance) that has been made to _popularise_ this fascinating subject </s>
<s> It has cost me _years_ of hard work: but if it should prove, as I hope it may, to be of _real_ service to the young, and to be taken up, in High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that I have expended on it </s>

<s> _Christmas, 1896._ pg-xi INTRODUCTION </s>
<s> _TO LEARNERS._ [N.B </s>
<s> Some remarks, addressed to _Teachers_, will be found in the Appendix, at p </s>
<s> 165.] The Learner, who wishes to try the question _fairly_, whether this little book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation, is _earnestly_ advised to adopt the following Rules:-- (1) Begin at the _beginning_, and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there </s>
<s> This would very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark "This is _much_ too hard for me"!, and thus losing the chance of adding a very _large_ item to your stock of mental delights </s>
<s> This Rule (of not _dipping_) is very _desirable_ with _other_ kinds of books----such as novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on, so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course </s>
<s> Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into Vol </s>
<s> III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it _is_ as well just to know that all ends _happily_----that the much-persecuted lovers _do_ marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (_Qu._ Why in _India_ </s>
<s> _Ans._ Because, somehow, uncles never _can_ get rich anywhere else) dies at exactly the right moment----before taking the trouble to read Vol </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> This, I say, is _just_ permissible with a _novel_, where Vol </s>
<s> III has a _meaning_, even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story; but, with a _scientific_ book, it is sheer insanity: you will find the latter part _hopelessly_ unintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course </s>
<s> pg-xii (2) Don't begin any fresh Chapter, or Section, until you are certain that you _thoroughly_ understand the whole book _up to that point_, and that you have worked, correctly, most if not all of the examples which have been set </s>
<s> So long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely _conquered_, and that you are leaving no unsolved difficulties _behind_ you, which will be sure to turn up again later on, your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful </s>
<s> Otherwise, you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as you proceed, till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust </s>
<s> (3) When you come to any passage you don't understand, _read it again_: if you _still_ don't understand it, _read it again_: if you fail, even after _three_ readings, very likely your brain is getting a little tired </s>
<s> In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations, and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that it is _quite_ easy </s>
<s> (4) If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along with you, and will talk over the difficulties with you </s>
<s> _Talking_ is a wonderful smoother-over of difficulties </s>
<s> When _I_ come upon anything----in Logic or in any other hard subject----that entirely puzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, _aloud_, even when I am all alone </s>
<s> One can explain things so _clearly_ to one's self </s>
<s> And then, you know, one is so _patient_ with one's self: one _never_ gets irritated at one's own stupidity </s>
<s> If, dear Reader, you will faithfully observe these Rules, and so give my little book a really _fair_ trial, I promise you, most confidently, that you will find Symbolic Logic to be one of the most, if not _the_ most, fascinating of mental recreations </s>
<s> In this First Part, I have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of (say) twelve or fourteen years of age </s>
<s> I have myself taught most of its contents, _vivÃ¢ voce_, to _many_ children, and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject </s>
<s> For those, who succeed in mastering Part I, and who begin, like Oliver, "asking for more," I hope to provide, in Part II, some _tolerably_ hard nuts to crack----nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen to possess </s>
<s> pg-xiii Mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games, such as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game "Halma" </s>
<s> But, after all, when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these Games, you have nothing real to _show_ for it, as a _result!_ You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, _at the time_: but you have no _result_ that you can treasure up and get real _good_ out of </s>
<s> And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect _mine_ of wealth </s>
<s> Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that will be of real _use_ to you in _any_ subject you may take up </s>
<s> It will give you clearness of thought----the ability to _see your way_ through a puzzle----the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get-at-able form----and, more valuable than all, the power to detect _fallacies_, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches, and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art </s>
<s> _Try it._ That is all I ask of you </s>

<s> _CLASSIFICATION._ 'Classification,' or the formation of Classes, is a Mental Process, in which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain Things </s>
<s> Such a group is called a '=Class=' </s>
<s> This Process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:-- (1) We may imagine that we have put together all Things </s>
<s> The Class so formed (i.e </s>
<s> the Class "Things") contains the whole Universe </s>
<s> (2) We may think of the Class "Things," and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class </s>
<s> This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the Class so formed </s>
<s> In this case, the Class "Things" is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is called a '=Species=' of the Class "Things": and its peculiar Adjunct is called its '=Differentia=' </s>
<s> pg002 As this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there _is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct </s>
<s> If there _is_, the Class is said to be '=Real='; if not, it is said to be '=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=' </s>
<s> [For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the Class "Things," all the Things which possess the Adjunct "material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets"; and we may thus form the Real Class "towns" </s>
<s> Here we may regard "Things" as a _Genus_, "Towns" as a _Species_ of Things, and "material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets" as its _Differentia_ </s>
<s> Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things which possess the Adjunct "weighing a ton, easily lifted by a baby"; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class "Things that weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby".] (3) We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class "Things," and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class </s>
<s> This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the smaller Class so formed </s>
<s> In this case, the Class thought of is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a '=Species=' of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its '=Differentia=' </s>
<s> [For example, we may think of the Class "towns," and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the Attribute "lit with gas"; and we may thus form the Real Class "towns lit with gas" </s>
<s> Here we may regard "Towns" as a _Genus_, "Towns lit with gas" as a _Species_ of Towns, and "lit with gas" as its _Differentia_ </s>
<s> If, in the above example, we were to alter "lit with gas" into "paved with gold," we should get the _Imaginary_ Class "towns paved with gold".] A Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an '=Individual=' </s>
<s> [For example, the Class "towns having four million inhabitants," which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz </s>
<s> "London".] pg002Â½ Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class </s>
<s> [Thus "London" may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked out from the Class "towns," which has, as its Differentia, "having four million inhabitants".] A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one single Thing_ </s>
<s> When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately </s>
<s> [Thus, the Class "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment," when regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute "formed in square," which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.] pg003 CHAPTER III </s>
<s> _DIVISION._ Â§ 1 </s>
<s> _Introductory._ 'Division' is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller Classes </s>
<s> [Thus, we might think of the Class "books," and imagine that we had divided it into the two smaller Classes "bound books" and "unbound books," or into the three Classes, "books priced at less than a shilling," "shilling-books," "books priced at more than a shilling," or into the twenty-six Classes, "books whose names begin with _A_," "books whose names begin with _B_," &c.] A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be 'codivisional' with every Class obtained by that Division </s>
<s> [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with each of the two Classes, "bound books" and "unbound books" </s>
<s> Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been "contemporary" with every event that happened in 1815.] Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself </s>
<s> [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with itself </s>
<s> Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been "contemporary" with itself.] pg003Â½ Â§ 2 </s>
<s> _Dichotomy._ If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class </s>
<s> Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the word "not"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose DifferentiÃ¦ are _contradictory_ </s>
<s> This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy=' </s>
<s> [For example, we may divide "books" into the two Classes whose DifferentiÃ¦ are "old" and "not-old".] In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and _which_ to the other </s>
<s> In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the other begin </s>
<s> [Thus, in dividing "books" into "old" and "not-old," we may say "Let all books printed before A.D </s>
<s> 1801, be regarded as 'old,' and all others as 'not-old'".] Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided into two Classes, whose DifferentiÃ¦ have contrary meanings, each Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word "not" prefixed </s>
<s> [Thus, if "books" be divided into "old" and "new" the Attribute "old" is to be regarded as equivalent to "not-new," and the Attribute "new" as equivalent to "not-old".] pg004 After dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes; and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition </s>
<s> [For example, we may divide "books" into "old" and "new" (i.e </s>
<s> "_not_-old"): we may then sub-divide each of these into "English" and "foreign" (i.e </s>
<s> "_not_-English"), thus getting _four_ Classes, viz </s>
<s> (1) old English; (2) old foreign; (3) new English; (4) new foreign </s>
<s> If we had begun by dividing into "English" and "foreign," and had then sub-divided into "old" and "new," the four Classes would have been (1) English old; (2) English new; (3) foreign old; (4) foreign new </s>
<s> The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four Classes which we had before.] pg004Â½ CHAPTER IV </s>
<s> _NAMES._ The word "Thing", which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea of an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing </s>
<s> Any other word (or phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an Adjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_ </s>
<s> Such a word (or phrase) is called a '=Name='; and, if there be an existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that Thing </s>
<s> [For example, the words "Thing," "Treasure," "Town," and the phrases "valuable Thing," "material artificial Thing consisting of houses and streets," "Town lit with gas," "Town paved with gold," "old English Book".] Just as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing represented by it </s>
<s> [Thus, "Town lit with gas" is a _Real_ Name: "Town paved with gold" is an _Unreal_ Name.] Every Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of a Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) </s>
<s> Every Name, except "Thing", may usually be expressed in three different forms:-- (_a_) The Substantive "Thing", and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying the ideas of the Attributes; pg005 (_b_) A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of _some_ of the Attributes, and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying the ideas of the _other_ Attributes; (_c_) A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of _all_ the Attributes </s>
<s> [Thus, the phrase "material living Thing, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet" is a Name expressed in Form (_a_) </s>
<s> If we choose to roll up together the Substantive "Thing" and the Adjectives "material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom," so as to make the new Substantive "Animal," we get the phrase "Animal having two hands and two feet," which is a Name (representing the same Thing as before) expressed in Form (_b_) </s>
<s> And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so as to make the new Substantive "Man," we get a Name (still representing the very same Thing) expressed in Form (_c_).] A Name, whose Substantive is in the _plural_ number, may be used to represent either (1) Members of a Class, _regarded as separate Things_; or (2) a whole Class, _regarded as one single Thing_ </s>
<s> [Thus, when I say "Some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are tall," or "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave," I am using the Name "soldiers of the Tenth Regiment" in the _first_ sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of them _separately_, and to say "_This_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall," "_That_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall," and so on </s>
<s> But, when I say "The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed in square," I am using the phrase in the _second_ sense; and it is just the same as if I were to say "The _Tenth Regiment_ is formed in square".] pg006 CHAPTER V </s>
<s> _DEFINITIONS._ It is evident that every Member of a _Species_ is _also_ a Member of the _Genus_ out of which that Species has been picked, and that it possesses the _Differentia_ of that Species </s>
<s> Hence it may be represented by a Name consisting of two parts, one being a Name representing any Member of the _Genus_, and the other being the _Differentia_ of that Species </s>
<s> Such a Name is called a '=Definition=' of any Member of that Species, and to give it such a Name is to '=define=' it </s>
<s> [Thus, we may define a "Treasure" as a "valuable Thing" </s>
<s> In this case we regard "Things" as the _Genus_, and "valuable" as the _Differentia_.] The following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for working others </s>
<s> [Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a Member (or Members) of the _Genus_, is printed in Capitals.] 1 </s>

<s> Define "London" </s>
<s> _Ans._ "the material artificial THING, which consists of houses and streets, and has four million inhabitants"; or else "the TOWN which has four million inhabitants" </s>
<s> [Note that we here use the article "the" instead of "a", because we happen to know that there is only _one_ such Thing </s>
<s> The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such as "house," "tree," "knife"), making a Definition for it, and then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary.] pg008 BOOK II </s>
<s> PROPOSITIONS </s>
<s> CHAPTER I </s>
<s> _PROPOSITIONS GENERALLY._ Â§ 1 </s>
<s> _Introductory._ Note that the word "some" is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning "one or more" </s>
<s> The word 'Proposition,' as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied to _any_ word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever </s>
<s> [Thus the words "yes" and "no" are Propositions in the ordinary sense of the word; and so are the phrases "you owe me five farthings" and "I don't" </s>
<s> Such words as "oh" </s>
<s> or "never"!, and such phrases as "fetch me that book" </s>
<s> "which book do you mean" </s>
<s> do not seem, at first sight, to convey any _information_; but they can easily be turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz </s>
<s> "I am surprised," "I will never consent to it," "I order you to fetch me that book," "I want to know which book you mean".] But a '=Proposition=,' as used in this First Part of "Symbolic Logic," has a peculiar form, which may be called its '=Normal form='; and if any Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form, we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it </s>
<s> pg009 A '=Proposition=,' when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two Classes, which are called its '=Subject=' and '=Predicate=,' either (1) that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate; or (2) that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate; or (3) that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate </s>
<s> The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its '=Terms=' </s>
<s> Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be '=equivalent=' </s>
<s> [Thus, the two Propositions, "I see John" and "John is seen by me," are equivalent.] Â§ 2 </s>
<s> _Normal form of a Proposition._ A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.-- (1) The word "some," or "no," or "all" </s>
<s> (This word, which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject are also Members of the Predicate, is called the '=Sign of Quantity='.) (2) Name of Subject </s>
<s> (3) The verb "are" (or "is") </s>
<s> (This is called the '=Copula='.) (4) Name of Predicate </s>
<s> pg010 Â§ 3 </s>
<s> _Various kinds of Propositions._ A Proposition, that begins with "Some", is said to be '=Particular=' </s>
<s> It is also called 'a Proposition =in I=' </s>
<s> [Note, that it is called 'Particular,' because it refers to a _part_ only of the Subject.] A Proposition, that begins with "No", is said to be '=Universal Negative=' </s>
<s> It is also called 'a Proposition =in E=' </s>
<s> A Proposition, that begins with "All", is said to be '=Universal Affirmative=' </s>
<s> It is also called 'a Proposition =in A=' </s>
<s> [Note, that they are called 'Universal', because they refer to the _whole_ of the Subject.] A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as _Universal_ </s>
<s> [Let us take, as an example, the Proposition "John is not well" </s>
<s> This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom the speaker refers when he mentions "John", and whom the listener _knows_ to be referred to </s>
<s> Hence the Class "men referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John'" is a one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to "_All_ the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John', are not well".] Propositions are of two kinds, 'Propositions of Existence' and 'Propositions of Relation' </s>
<s> These shall be discussed separately </s>
<s> pg011 CHAPTER II </s>
<s> _PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._ A '=Proposition of Existence=', when in normal form, has, for its _Subject_, the Class "existing Things" </s>
<s> Its Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" </s>
<s> [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0" and "1 or more".] It is called "a Proposition of Existence" because its effect is to assert the _Reality_ (i.e </s>
<s> the real _existence_), or else the _Imaginariness_, of its Predicate </s>
<s> [Thus, the Proposition "Some existing Things are honest men" asserts that the Class "honest men" is _Real_ </s>
<s> This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:-- (1) "Honest men exist"; (2) "Some honest men exist"; (3) "The Class 'honest men' exists"; (4) "There are honest men"; (5) "There are some honest men" </s>
<s> Similarly, the Proposition "No existing Things are men fifty feet high" asserts that the Class "men 50 feet high" is _Imaginary_ </s>
<s> This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:-- (1) "Men 50 feet high do not exist"; (2) "No men 50 feet high exist"; (3) "The Class 'men 50 feet high' does not exist"; (4) "There are not any men 50 feet high"; (5) "There are no men 50 feet high".] pg012 CHAPTER III </s>
<s> _PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._ Â§ 1 </s>
<s> _Introductory._ A =Proposition of Relation=, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two Names conveys the idea of some Attribute _not_ conveyed by the other </s>
<s> [Thus, the Proposition "Some merchants are misers" is of the right kind, since "merchants" and "misers" are Specieses of the same Genus "men"; and since the Name "merchants" conveys the idea of the Attribute "mercantile", and the name "misers" the idea of the Attribute "miserly", each of which ideas is _not_ conveyed by the other Name </s>
<s> But the Proposition "Some dogs are setters" is _not_ of the right kind, since, although it is true that "dogs" and "setters" are Specieses of the same Genus "animals", it is _not_ true that the Name "dogs" conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed by the Name "setters" </s>
<s> Such Propositions will be discussed in Part II.] The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the '=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.=' The Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" or "All" </s>
<s> [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0", "1 or more", "the total number of Members of the Subject".] It is called "a Proposition of Relation" because its effect is to assert that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms </s>
<s> pg013 Â§ 2 </s>
<s> _Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are _talking about_); (2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb "are" (or "is"), substitute for it a phrase beginning with "are" (or "is"); (3) Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is, which is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members of the Subject); (4) If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e </s>
<s> if it contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the 'Univ'.; but, if either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_ only, it is then necessary to determine a 'Univ'., in order to insert its Name as the Substantive </s>
<s> (5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_; (6) Arrange in the following order:-- Sign of Quantity, Subject, Copula, Predicate </s>
<s> [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules </s>
<s> (1) "Some apples are not ripe" </s>
<s> (1) The Subject is "apples" </s>
<s> (2) The Verb is "are" </s>
<s> (3) The Predicate is "not-ripe * * *" </s>
<s> (As no Substantive is expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ </s>
<s> is to be, we are forced to leave a blank.) (4) Let Univ </s>
<s> be "fruit" </s>
<s> (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some" </s>
<s> (6) The Proposition now becomes "Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit" </s>
<s> pg014 (2) "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent" </s>
<s> (1) The Subject is "my speculations" </s>
<s> (2) The Verb is "have brought," for which we substitute the phrase "are * * * that have brought" </s>
<s> (3) The Predicate is "* * * that have brought &c" </s>
<s> (4) Let Univ </s>
<s> be "transactions" </s>
<s> (5) The Sign of Quantity is "none of" </s>
<s> (6) The Proposition now becomes "None of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent" </s>
<s> (3) "None but the brave deserve the fair" </s>
<s> To begin with, we note that the phrase "none but the brave" is equivalent to "no _not_-brave" </s>
<s> (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ "not-brave" </s>
<s> But no _Substantive_ is supplied </s>
<s> So we express the Subject as "not-brave * * *" </s>
<s> (2) The Verb is "deserve," for which we substitute the phrase "are deserving of" </s>

<s> (4) "A lame puppy would not say "thank you" if you offered to lend it a skipping-rope" </s>
<s> (1) The Subject is evidently "lame puppies," and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate </s>
<s> (2) The Verb is "would not say," &c., for which we may substitute the phrase "are not grateful for" </s>
<s> (3) The Predicate may be expressed as "* * * not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope" </s>
<s> (4) Let Univ </s>
<s> be "puppies" </s>

<s> (6) The Proposition now becomes "All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope" </s>
<s> pg015 (5) "No one takes in the _Times_, unless he is well-educated" </s>
<s> (1) The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated ("no _one_" evidently means "no _person_") </s>

<s> (1) The Subject is "my carriage" </s>
<s> This, being an 'Individual,' is equivalent to the Class "my carriages" </s>

<s> (1) The Subject is evidently "the man &c" </s>
<s> (Note that in this sentence, the _Predicate_ comes first.) At first sight, the Subject seems to be an '_Individual_'; but on further consideration, we see that the article "the" does _not_ imply that there is only _one_ such man </s>

<s> (2) The Verb is "are" </s>
<s> (3) The Predicate is "happy * * *" </s>

<s> _SYMBOLS AND CELLS._ First, let us suppose that the above _left_-hand Diagram is the Biliteral Diagram that we have been using in Book III., and that we change it into a _Triliteral_ Diagram by drawing an _Inner Square_, so as to divide each of its 4 Cells into 2 portions, thus making 8 Cells altogether </s>
<s> The _right_-hand Diagram shows the result </s>
<s> [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_ to refer to the above Diagrams, but to make a large copy of the right-hand one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it, about which he is reading.] pg040 Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call "m", and have subdivided the xy-Class into the two Classes whose DifferentiÃ¦ are m and m', and that we have assigned the N.W </s>
<s> _Inner_ Cell to the one (which we may call "the Class of xym-Things", or "the xym-Class"), and the N.W </s>
<s> _Outer_ Cell to the other (which we may call "the Class of xym'-Things", or "the xym'-Class") </s>
<s> [Thus, in the "books" example, we might say "Let m mean 'bound', so that m' will mean 'unbound'", and we might suppose that we had subdivided the Class "old English books" into the two Classes, "old English bound books" and "old English unbound books", and had assigned the N.W </s>
<s> _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the N.W </s>
<s> _Outer_ Cell to the other.] Thirdly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the xy'-Class, the x'y-Class, and the x'y'-Class in the same manner, and have, in each case, assigned the _Inner_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m, and the _Outer_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m' </s>
<s> [Thus, in the "books" example, we might suppose that we had subdivided the "new English books" into the two Classes, "new English bound books" and "new English unbound books", and had assigned the S.W </s>
<s> _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the S.W </s>
<s> _Outer_ Cell to the other.] It is evident that we have now assigned the _Inner Square_ to the m-Class, and the _Outer Border_ to the m'-Class </s>
<s> [Thus, in the "books" example, we have assigned the _Inner Square_ to "bound books" and the _Outer Border_ to "unbound books".] When the Reader has made himself familiar with this Diagram, he ought to be able to find, in a moment, the Compartment assigned to a particular _pair_ of Attributes, or the Cell assigned to a particular _trio_ of Attributes </s>

<s> CHAPTER I </s>
<s> _INTRODUCTORY_ When a Trio of Biliteral Propositions of Relation is such that (1) all their six Terms are Species of the same Genus, (2) every two of them contain between them a Pair of codivisional Classes, (3) the three Propositions are so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true, the Trio is called a '=Syllogism='; the Genus, of which each of the six Terms is a Species, is called its ='Universe of Discourse=', or, more briefly, its '=Univ.='; the first two Propositions are called its '=Premisses=', and the third its '=Conclusion='; also the Pair of codivisional Terms in the Premisses are called its '=Eliminands=', and the other two its '=Retinends=' </s>
<s> The Conclusion of a Syllogism is said to be '=consequent=' from its Premisses: hence it is usual to prefix to it the word "Therefore" (or the Symbol "'.".) </s>
<s> pg057 [Note that the 'Eliminands' are so called because they are _eliminated_, and do not appear in the Conclusion; and that the 'Retinends' are so called because they are _retained_, and _do_ appear in the Conclusion </s>
<s> Note also that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any of the Trio, but depends entirely on their _relationship to each other_ </s>
<s> As a specimen-Syllogism, let us take the Trio "No x-Things are m-Things; No y-Things are m'-Things </s>
<s> No x-Things are y-Things" </s>
<s> which we may write, as explained at p </s>
<s> 26, thus:-- "No x are m; No y are m' </s>
<s> No x are y" </s>
<s> Here the first and second contain the Pair of codivisional Classes m and m'; the first and third contain the Pair x and x; and the second and third contain the Pair y and y </s>
<s> Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see hereafter) so related that, if the first two were true, the third would also be true </s>
<s> Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the two Propositions, "No x are m" and "No y are m'", are its _Premisses_; the Proposition "No x are y" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms m and m' are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms x and y are its _Retinends_ </s>
<s> Hence we may write it thus:-- "No x are m; No y are m' </s>
<s> '. </s>
<s> No x are y" </s>
<s> As a second specimen, let us take the Trio "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats </s>
<s> Some chickens understand French" </s>
<s> These, put into normal form, are "All cats are creatures understanding French; Some chickens are cats </s>
<s> Some chickens are creatures understanding French" </s>
<s> Here all the six Terms are Species of the Genus "creatures" </s>
<s> Also the first and second Propositions contain the Pair of codivisional Classes "cats" and "cats"; the first and third contain the Pair "creatures understanding French" and "creatures understanding French"; and the second and third contain the Pair "chickens" and "chickens" </s>
<s> pg058 Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see at p </s>
<s> 64) so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true </s>
<s> (The first two are, as it happens, _not_ strictly true in _our_ planet </s>
<s> But there is nothing to hinder them from being true in some _other_ planet, say _Mars_ or _Jupiter_--in which case the third would _also_ be true in that planet, and its inhabitants would probably engage chickens as nursery-governesses </s>
<s> They would thus secure a singular _contingent_ privilege, unknown in England, namely, that they would be able, at any time when provisions ran short, to utilise the nursery-governess for the nursery-dinner!) Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the Genus "creatures" is its 'Univ'.; the two Propositions, "All cats understand French" and "Some chickens are cats", are its _Premisses_, the Proposition "Some chickens understand French" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms "cats" and "cats" are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms, "creatures understanding French" and "chickens", are its _Retinends_ </s>

<s> _PROBLEMS IN SYLLOGISMS._ Â§ 1 </s>
<s> _Introductory._ When the Terms of a Proposition are represented by _words_, it is said to be '=concrete='; when by _letters_, '=abstract=' </s>
<s> To translate a Proposition from concrete into abstract form, we fix on a Univ., and regard each Term as a _Species_ of it, and we choose a letter to represent its _Differentia_ </s>
<s> [For example, suppose we wish to translate "Some soldiers are brave" into abstract form </s>
<s> We may take "men" as Univ., and regard "soldiers" and "brave men" as _Species_ of the _Genus_ "men"; and we may choose x to represent the peculiar Attribute (say "military") of "soldiers," and y to represent "brave" </s>
<s> Then the Proposition may be written "Some military men are brave men"; _i.e._ "Some x-men are y-men"; _i.e._ (omitting "men," as explained at p </s>
<s> 26) "Some x are y" </s>
<s> In practice, we should merely say "Let Univ </s>
<s> be "men", xÂ =Â soldiers, yÂ =Â brave", and at once translate "Some soldiers are brave" into "Some x are y".] The Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz </s>
<s> (1) "Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them" </s>
<s> (2) "Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is _complete_" </s>
<s> These Problems we will discuss separately </s>
<s> pg060 Â§ 2 </s>
<s> _Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Determine the 'Universe of Discourse' </s>
<s> (2) Construct a Dictionary, making m and m (or m and m') represent the pair of codivisional Classes, and x (or x') and y (or y') the other two </s>
<s> (3) Translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form </s>
<s> (4) Represent them, together, on a Triliteral Diagram </s>
<s> (5) Ascertain what Proposition, if any, in terms of x and y, is _also_ represented on it </s>
<s> (6) Translate this into concrete form </s>
<s> It is evident that, if the proposed Premisses were true, this other Proposition would _also_ be true </s>
<s> Hence it is a _Conclusion_ consequent from the proposed Premisses </s>
<s> [Let us work some examples </s>
<s> (1) "No son of mine is dishonest; People always treat an honest man with respect" </s>
<s> Taking "men" as Univ., we may write these as follows:-- "No sons of mine are dishonest men; All honest men are men treated with respect" </s>
<s> We can now construct our Dictionary, viz </s>
<s> mÂ =Â honest; xÂ =Â sons of mine; yÂ =Â treated with respect </s>
<s> (Note that the expression "xÂ =Â sons of mine" is an abbreviated form of "xÂ =Â the Differentia of 'sons of mine', when regarded as a Species of 'men'".) The next thing is to translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form, as follows:-- "No x are m'; All m are y" </s>
<s> pg061 Next, by the process described at p </s>
<s> 50, we represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, thus:-- Â·---------------Â· |(O) | (O)| | Â·---|---Â· | | | |(O)| | |---|(I)|---|---| | | |(O)| | | Â·---|---Â· | | | | Â·---------------Â· Next, by the process described at p </s>

<s> Â·-------Â· | |(O)| |---|---| | | | Â·-------Â· The result we read as "No x are y'" or as "No y' are x," whichever we prefer </s>
<s> So we refer to our Dictionary, to see which will look best; and we choose "No x are y'", which, translated into concrete form, is "No son of mine fails to be treated with respect" </s>
<s> (2) "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats" </s>
<s> Taking "creatures" as Univ., we write these as follows:-- "All cats are creatures understanding French; Some chickens are cats" </s>

<s> The proposed Premisses, translated into abstract form, are "All m are x; Some y are m" </s>

<s> [Thus, the expression xm_{0} + ym'_{0} Â¶ xy_{0} is a Formula, by which we can find the Conclusion to any Pair of Premisses whose subscript forms are xm_{0} + ym'_{0} For example, suppose we had the Pair of Propositions "No gluttons are healthy; No unhealthy men are strong" </s>

<s> CHAPTER I </s>
<s> _INTRODUCTORY._ When a Set of three or more Biliteral Propositions are such that all their Terms are Species of the same Genus, and are also so related that two of them, taken together, yield a Conclusion, which, taken with another of them, yields another Conclusion, and so on, until all have been taken, it is evident that, if the original Set were true, the last Conclusion would _also_ be true </s>
<s> Such a Set, with the last Conclusion tacked on, is called a '=Sorites='; the original Set of Propositions is called its '=Premisses='; each of the intermediate Conclusions is called a '=Partial Conclusion=' of the Sorites; the last Conclusion is called its '=Complete Conclusion=,' or, more briefly, its '=Conclusion='; the Genus, of which all the Terms are Species, is called its '=Universe of Discourse=', or, more briefly, its '=Univ.='; the Terms, used as Eliminands in the Syllogisms, are called its '=Eliminands='; and the two Terms, which are retained, and therefore appear in the Conclusion, are called its '=Retinends=' </s>
<s> [Note that each _Partial_ Conclusion contains one or two _Eliminands_; but that the _Complete_ Conclusion contains _Retinends_ only.] The Conclusion is said to be '=consequent=' from the Premisses; for which reason it is usual to prefix to it the word "Therefore" (or the symbol "'.".) </s>
<s> [Note that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any one of the Propositions which make up the Sorites, by depends entirely on their _relationship to one another_ </s>
<s> pg086 As a specimen-Sorites, let us take the following Set of 5 Propositions:-- (1) "No a are b'; (2) All b are c; (3) All c are d; (4) No e' are a'; (5) All h are e'" </s>
<s> Here the first and second, taken together, yield "No a are c'" </s>
<s> This, taken along with the third, yields "No a are d'" </s>
<s> This, taken along with the fourth, yields "No d' are e'" </s>
<s> And this, taken along with the fifth, yields "All h are d" </s>
<s> Hence, if the original Set were true, this would _also_ be true </s>
<s> Hence the original Set, with this tacked on, is a _Sorites_; the original Set is its _Premisses_; the Proposition "All h are d" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms a, b, c, e are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms d and h are its _Retinends_ </s>
<s> Hence we may write the whole Sorites thus:-- "No a are b'; All b are c; All c are d; No e' are a'; All h are e' </s>
<s> '. </s>
<s> All h are d" </s>
<s> In the above Sorites, the 3 Partial Conclusions are the Positions "No a are e'", "No a are d'", "No d' are e'"; but, if the Premisses were arranged in other ways, other Partial Conclusions might be obtained </s>
<s> Thus, the order 41523 yields the Partial Conclusions "No c' are b'", "All h are b", "All h are c" </s>
<s> There are altogether _nine_ Partial Conclusions to this Sorites, which the Reader will find it an interesting task to make out for himself.] pg087 CHAPTER II </s>
<s> _PROBLEMS IN SORITESES._ Â§ 1 </s>
<s> _Introductory._ The Problems we shall have to solve are of the following form:-- "Given three or more Propositions of Relation, which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them" </s>
<s> We will limit ourselves, at present, to Problems which can be worked by the FormulÃ¦ of Fig </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> (See p </s>
<s> 75.) Those, that require _other_ FormulÃ¦, are rather too hard for beginners </s>
<s> Such Problems may be solved by either of two Methods, viz </s>
<s> (1) The Method of Separate Syllogisms; (2) The Method of Underscoring </s>
<s> These shall be discussed separately </s>
<s> pg088 Â§ 2 </s>
<s> _Solution by Method of Separate Syllogisms._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Name the 'Universe of Discourse' </s>
<s> (2) Construct a Dictionary, making a, b, c, &c </s>

<s> (3) Put the Proposed Premisses into subscript form </s>
<s> (4) Select two which, containing between them a pair of codivisional Classes, can be used as the Premisses of a Syllogism </s>
<s> (5) Find their Conclusion by Formula </s>
<s> (6) Find a third Premiss which, along with this Conclusion, can be used as the Premisses of a second Syllogism </s>
<s> (7) Find a second Conclusion by Formula </s>
<s> (8) Proceed thus, until all the proposed Premisses have been used </s>
<s> (9) Put the last Conclusion, which is the Complete Conclusion of the Sorites, into concrete form </s>
<s> [As an example of this process, let us take, as the proposed Set of Premisses, (1) "All the policemen on this beat sup with our cook; (2) No man with long hair can fail to be a poet; (3) Amos Judd has never been in prison; (4) Our cook's 'cousins' all love cold mutton; (5) None but policemen on this beat are poets; (6) None but her 'cousins' ever sup with our cook; (7) Men with short hair have all been in prison" </s>

<s> Â§ 1 </s>
<s> _Introductory._ There are several matters, too hard to discuss with _Learners_, which nevertheless need to be explained to any _Teachers_, into whose hands this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my Symbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many other Methods already published </s>
<s> These matters are as follows:-- The "Existential Import" of Propositions </s>
<s> The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula </s>
<s> The theory "two Negative Premisses prove nothing" </s>
<s> Euler's Method of Diagrams </s>

<s> My Method of Diagrams </s>
<s> The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods </s>

<s> Some account of Parts II, III </s>
<s> Â§ 2 </s>
<s> _The "Existential Import" of Propositions._ The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the ordinary grooves----to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope inoffensive) title "The Logicians"----take, on this subject, what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary </s>
<s> They speak of the Copula of a Proposition "with bated breath", almost as if it were a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but to ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to it </s>
<s> pg166 In opposition to this view, I maintain that any writer of a book is fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use </s>
<s> If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his book, "Let it be understood that by the word '_black_' I shall always mean '_white_', and that by the word '_white_' I shall always mean '_black_'," I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think it </s>
<s> And so, with regard to the question whether a Proposition is or is not to be understood as asserting the existence of its Subject, I maintain that every writer may adopt his own rule, provided of course that it is consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of Logic </s>
<s> Let us consider certain views that may _logically_ be held, and thus settle which of them may _conveniently_ be held; after which I shall hold myself free to declare which of them _I_ intend to hold </s>
<s> The _kinds_ of Propositions, to be considered, are those that begin with "some", with "no", and with "all" </s>
<s> These are usually called Propositions "in _I_", "in _E_", and "in _A_" </s>
<s> First, then, a Proposition in _I_ may be understood as asserting, or else as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject </s>
<s> (By "existence" I mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature </s>
<s> The two Propositions, "_dreams_ exist" and "_drums_ exist", denote two totally different kinds of "existence" </s>
<s> A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and exists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate of wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_.) First, let us suppose that _I_ "asserts" (i.e </s>
<s> "asserts the existence of its Subject") </s>
<s> Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the _same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_ </s>
<s> We now have _I_ and _A_ "asserting" </s>
<s> Does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to _E_ </s>
<s> My answer is "No </s>
<s> We are tied down to the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert" </s>
<s> This can be proved as follows:-- If possible, let _E_ "assert" </s>
<s> Then (taking x, y, and z to represent Attributes) we see that, if the Proposition "No xy are z" be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e </s>
<s> "Some x are y" </s>
<s> pg167 Also we know that, if the Proposition "Some xy are z" be true, the same result follows </s>
<s> But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true </s>
<s> Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e </s>
<s> the Proposition "Some x are y" is _always_ true </s>
<s> _Quod est absurdum._ (See Note (A), p </s>
<s> 195) </s>
<s> We see, then, that the supposition "_I_ asserts" necessarily leads to "_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not" </s>
<s> And this is the _first_ of the various views that may conceivably be held </s>
<s> Next, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ "assert" </s>
<s> And, along with this, let us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ "assert" </s>
<s> Hence the Proposition "No x are y" means "Some x exist, and none of them are y": i.e </s>
<s> "_all_ of them are _not_-y," which is a Proposition in _A_ </s>
<s> We also know, of course, that the Proposition "All x are not-y" proves "No x are y" </s>
<s> Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are _equivalent_ </s>
<s> Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in _E_, and therefore "_asserts_" </s>
<s> Hence our _second_ conceivable view is "_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does not" </s>
<s> This view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of Logic </s>
<s> But, when we come to _test_ it, as applied to the actual _facts_ of life, we shall find I think, that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say the least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk </s>
<s> Let me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones, who is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly _Logical_ principles </s>
<s> _Author._ "Well, Jones </s>
<s> Have you got your new Club started yet" </s>
<s> _Jones_ (_rubbing his hands_) </s>
<s> "You'll be glad to hear that some of the Members (mind, I only say '_some_') are millionaires </s>
<s> Rolling in gold, my boy" </s>
<s> _Author._ "That sounds well </s>
<s> And how many Members have entered" </s>
<s> _Jones_ (_staring_) </s>
<s> "None at all </s>
<s> We haven't got it started yet </s>
<s> What makes you think we have" </s>
<s> _Author._ "Why, I thought you said that some of the Members----" pg168 _Jones_ (_contemptuously_) </s>
<s> "You don't seem to be aware that we're working on strictly _Logical_ principles </s>
<s> A _Particular_ Proposition does _not_ assert the existence of its Subject </s>
<s> I merely meant to say that we've made a Rule not to admit _any_ Members till we have at least _three_ Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year" </s>
<s> _Author._ "Oh, _that's_ what you meant, is it </s>
<s> Let's hear some more of your Rules" </s>
<s> _Jones._ "Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of forgery, is admissible" </s>
<s> _Author._ "And here, again, I suppose you don't mean to assert there _are_ any such convicts in existence" </s>
<s> _Jones._ "Why, that's exactly what I _do_ mean to assert </s>
<s> Don't you know that a Universal Negative _asserts_ the existence of its Subject </s>
<s> _Of course_ we didn't make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living" </s>
<s> The Reader can now decide for himself how far this _second_ conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life </s>
<s> He will, I think, agree with me that Jones' view, of the 'Existential Import' of Propositions, would lead to some inconvenience </s>
<s> Thirdly, let us suppose that neither _I_ nor _E_ "asserts" </s>
<s> Now the supposition that the two Propositions, "Some x are y" and "No x are not-y", do _not_ "assert", necessarily involves the supposition that "All x are y" does _not_ "assert", since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken separately </s>
<s> Hence the _third_ (and last) of the conceivable views is that neither _I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, "asserts" </s>
<s> The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition "Some x are y" to mean "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_ be y"; and so with _E_ and _A_ </s>
<s> It admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the accepted facts of Logic </s>
<s> Let us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as valid </s>
<s> Its form is "All m are x; All m are y </s>
<s> '. </s>
<s> Some y are x" </s>
<s> pg169 This they would interpret as follows:-- "If there were any m in existence, all of them would be x; If there were any m in existence, all of them would be y </s>
<s> '. </s>
<s> If there were any y in existence, some of them would be x" </s>
<s> That this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by Mr Keynes (in his "Formal Logic", dated 1894, pp </s>
<s> 356, 357), that I prefer to quote his words:-- "_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its predicate._ "Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:-- '_All M is P_, _All M is S_, _'. </s>
<s> Some S is P_' </s>
<s> "Taking S, M, P, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the conclusion will imply that, if there is an S, there is some P </s>
<s> Will the premisses also imply this </s>
<s> If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not otherwise </s>
<s> "The conclusion implies that if S exists P exists; but, consistently with the premisses, S may be existent while M and P are both non-existent </s>
<s> An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion, which is not justified by the premisses" </s>
<s> This seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing </s>
<s> Still, "to make sicker", I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_) Syllogism into a concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical Reader </s>
<s> Let us suppose that a Boys' School has been set up, with the following system of Rules:-- "All boys in the First (the highest) Class are to do French, Greek, and Latin </s>
<s> All in the Second Class are to do Greek only </s>
<s> All in the Third Class are to do Latin only" </s>
<s> Suppose also that there _are_ boys in the Third Class, and in the Second; but that no boy has yet risen into the First </s>
<s> It is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still we know, by the Rules, what would happen if there _were_ any </s>
<s> pg170 We are authorised, then, by the _Data_, to assert the following two Propositions:-- "If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Greek; If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Latin" </s>
<s> And the Conclusion, according to "The Logicians" would be "If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would be doing Greek" </s>
<s> Here, then, we have two _true_ Premisses and a _false_ Conclusion (since we know that there _are_ boys doing Latin, and that _none_ of them are doing Greek) </s>

<s> Now the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, "Some boys, who will receive prizes, are in the First Class", which means (according to "The Logicians") "If there _were_ any boys about to receive prizes, some of them _would_ be in the First Class" (which Class we know to be _empty_) </s>

<s> _The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula._ Is it better to say "John _is-not_ in-the-house" or "John _is_ not-in-the-house" </s>
<s> "Some of my acquaintances _are-not_ men-I-should-like-to-be-seen-with" or "Some of my acquaintances _are_ men-I-should-_not_-like-to-be-seen-with" </s>
<s> That is the sort of question we have now to discuss </s>
<s> pg172 This is no question of Logical Right and Wrong: it is merely a matter of _taste_, since the two forms mean exactly the same thing </s>
<s> And here, again, "The Logicians" seem to me to take much too humble a position </s>
<s> When they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their Proposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the Copula----always a rather fussy 'heavy father', asks them "Am _I_ to have the 'not', or will you tack it on to the Predicate" </s>
<s> they are much too ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, "Leave it to _you_, Sir" </s>
<s> The result seems to be, that the grasping Copula constantly gets a "not" that had better have been merged in the Predicate, and that Propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as precisely similar </s>
<s> Surely it is simpler to treat "Some men are Jews" and "Some men are Gentiles" as being both of them, _affirmative_ Propositions, instead of translating the latter into "Some men are-not Jews", and regarding it as a _negative_ Propositions </s>
<s> The fact is, "The Logicians" have somehow acquired a perfectly _morbid_ dread of negative Attributes, which makes them shut their eyes, like frightened children, when they come across such terrible Propositions as "All not-x are y"; and thus they exclude from their system many very useful forms of Syllogisms </s>
<s> Under the influence of this unreasoning terror, they plead that, in Dichotomy by Contradiction, the _negative_ part is too large to deal with, so that it is better to regard each Thing as either included in, or excluded from, the _positive_ part </s>
<s> I see no force in this plea: and the facts often go the other way </s>
<s> As a personal question, dear Reader, if _you_ were to group your acquaintances into the two Classes, men that you _would_ like to be seen with, and men that you would _not_ like to be seen with, do you think the latter group would be so _very_ much the larger of the two </s>
<s> For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the _same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it "is" in the one, or that it "is" in the other, that I do not think any Reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course </s>
<s> pg173 Â§ 4 </s>
<s> _The theory that "two Negative Premisses prove nothing"._ This I consider to be _another_ craze of "The Logicians", fully as morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute </s>
<s> It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_ </s>
<s> Take the following Pairs of Premisses:-- "None of my boys are conceited; None of my girls are greedy" </s>
<s> "None of my boys are clever; None but a clever boy could solve this problem" </s>
<s> "None of my boys are learned; Some of my boys are not choristers" </s>
<s> (This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I should read it "are not-choristers"; but, in dealing with "The Logicians," I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_ would read it "are-not choristers".) If you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of Premisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from _any_ of them----why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you "will have to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy" </s>

<s> While they have elaborately discussed no less than _nineteen_ different forms of _Syllogisms_----each with its own special and exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored----they have limited _Sorites_ to _two_ forms only, of childish simplicity; and these they have dignified with special _names_, apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed </s>
<s> As to _Syllogisms_, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score of others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under _three_ forms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question the Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given at p </s>

<s> pg184 As to _Sorites_, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are the _Aristotelian_, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in A, so arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and the _Goclenian_, whose Premisses are the very same series, written backwards </s>

<s> These puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted freely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them, for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular Syllogisms </s>

<s> (A) [See p </s>
<s> 167, line 6.] It may, perhaps, occur to the Reader, who has studied Formal Logic that the argument, here applied to the Propositions I and E, will apply equally well to the Propositions I and A (since, in the ordinary text-books, the Propositions "All xy are z" and "Some xy are not z" are regarded as Contradictories) </s>
<s> Hence it may appear to him that the argument might have been put as follows:-- "We now have I and A 'asserting' </s>
<s> Hence, if the Proposition 'All xy are z' be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e </s>
<s> 'Some x are y' </s>
<s> "Also we know that, if the Proposition 'Some xy are not-z' be true the same result follows </s>
<s> "But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true </s>
<s> Hence this result is always true: i.e </s>
<s> the Proposition 'Some x are y' is _always_ true </s>
<s> "_Quod est absurdum._ Hence I _cannot_ assert" </s>
<s> This matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that _A_ and _I_ are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books, is untenable </s>
<s> The proof is as follows:-- With regard to the relationship existing between the Class 'xy' and the two Classes 'z' and 'not-z', there are _four_ conceivable states of things, viz </s>
<s> (1) Some xy are z, and some are not-z; (2) " " none " (3) No xy " some " (4) " " none " Of these four, No </s>
<s> (2) is equivalent to "All xy are z", No </s>
<s> (3) is equivalent to "All xy are not-z", and No </s>
<s> (4) is equivalent to "No xy exist" </s>
<s> Now it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each is, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three _must_ be false </s>
<s> Hence the Contradictory to (2) is "Either (1) or (3) or (4) is true" </s>
<s> Now the assertion "Either (1) or (3) is true" is equivalent to "Some xy are not-z"; and the assertion "(4) is true" is equivalent to "No xy exist" </s>
<s> Hence the Contradictory to "All xy are z" may be expressed as the Alternative Proposition "Either some xy are not-z, or no xy exist," but _not_ as the Categorical Proposition "Some y are not-z" </s>
<s> pg196 (B) [See p </s>
<s> 171, at end of Section 2.] There are yet _other_ views current among "The Logicians", as to the "Existential Import" of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in this Section </s>
<s> One is, that the Proposition "some x are y" is to be interpreted, neither as "Some x _exist_ and are y", nor yet as "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_ be y", but merely as "Some x _can be_ y; i.e </s>
<s> the Attributes x and y are _compatible_" </s>
<s> On _this_ theory, there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones "Some of your brothers are swindlers"; since, if he indignantly retorted "What do you _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel"?, I should calmly reply "I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_----that some of your brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers" </s>
<s> But it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones </s>
<s> Another view is, that the Proposition "All x are y" _sometimes_ implies the actual _existence_ of x, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and that we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_ interpretation we are to give to it </s>
