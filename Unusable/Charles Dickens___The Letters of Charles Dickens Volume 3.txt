<s> PREFACE </s>
<s> Since our publication of "The Letters of Charles Dickens" we have received the letters addressed to the late Lord Lytton, which we were unable to procure in time for our first two volumes in consequence of his son's absence in India </s>
<s> We thank the Earl of Lytton cordially for his kindness in sending them to us very soon after his return </s>
<s> We also offer our sincere thanks to Sir Austen H </s>
<s> Layard, and to the senders of many other letters, which we now publish for the first time </s>
<s> With a view to making our selection as complete as possible, we have collected together the letters from Charles Dickens which have already been published in various Biographies, and have chosen and placed in chronological order among our new letters those which we consider to be of the greatest interest </s>
<s> As our Narrative was finished in our second volume, this volume consists of Letters _only_, with occasional foot-notes wherever there are allusions requiring explanation </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Mr John Hullah.] FURNIVAL'S INN, _Sunday Evening (1836)_ (?) </s>
<s> MY DEAR HULLAH, Have you seen _The Examiner_ </s>
<s> It is rather depreciatory of the opera; but, like all inveterate critiques against Braham, so well done that I cannot help laughing at it, for the life and soul of me </s>
<s> I have seen _The Sunday Times_, _The Dispatch_, and _The Satirist_, all of which blow their critic trumpets against unhappy me most lustily </s>
<s> Either I must have grievously awakened the ire of all the "adapters" and their friends, or the drama must be decidedly bad </s>
<s> I haven't made up my mind yet which of the two is the fact </s>
<s> I have not seen the _John Bull_ or any of the Sunday papers except _The Spectator_ </s>
<s> If you have any of them, bring 'em with you on Tuesday </s>
<s> I am afraid that for "dirty Cummins'" allusion to Hogarth I shall be reduced to the necessity of being valorous the next time I meet him </s>
<s> Believe me, most faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] FURNIVAL'S INN, _Monday Afternoon, 7 o'clock (1836)._ MY DEAR HULLAH, Mr Hogarth has just been here, with news which I think you will be glad to hear </s>
<s> He was with Braham yesterday, who was _far more full_ of the opera[1] than he was; speaking highly of my works and "fame" (!), and expressing an earnest desire to be the first to introduce me to the public as a dramatic writer </s>
<s> He said that he intended opening at Michaelmas; and added (unasked) that it was his intention to produce the opera within _one month_ of his first night </s>
<s> He wants a low comedy part introduced--without singing--thinking it will take with the audience; but he is desirous of explaining to me what he means and who he intends to play it </s>
<s> I am to see him on Sunday morning </s>
<s> Full particulars of the interview shall be duly announced </s>
<s> Perhaps I shall see you meanwhile </s>
<s> I have only time to add that I am Most faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] PETERSHAM, _Monday Evening (1836)._ DEAR HULLAH, Since I called on you this morning I have not had time to look over the words of "The Child and the Old Man" </s>
<s> It occurs to me, as I shall see you on Wednesday morning, that the best plan will be for you to bring the music (if you possibly can) without the words, and we can put them in then </s>
<s> Of course this observation applies only to that particular song </s>
<s> Braham having sent to me about the farce, I called on him this morning </s>
<s> Harley wrote, when he had read the whole of the opera, saying: "It's a sure card--nothing wrong there </s>
<s> Bet you ten pound it runs fifty nights </s>
<s> Come; don't be afraid </s>
<s> You'll be the gainer by it, and you mustn't mind betting; it's a capital custom" </s>
<s> They tell the story with infinite relish </s>
<s> I saw the fair manageress,[2] who is fully of Harley's opinion, so is Braham </s>
<s> The only difference is, that they are far more enthusiastic than Harley--far more enthusiastic than ourselves even </s>
<s> That is a bold word, isn't it </s>
<s> It is a true one, nevertheless </s>
<s> "Depend upon it, sir," said Braham to Hogarth yesterday, when he went there to say I should be in town to-day, "depend upon it, sir, that there has been no such music since the days of Sheil, and no such piece since "The Duenna"." "Everybody is delighted with it," he added, to me to-day </s>
<s> "I played it to Stansbury, who is by no means an excitable person, and he was charmed" </s>
<s> This was said with great emphasis, but I have forgotten the grand point </s>
<s> It was not, "I played it to Stansbury," but, "I sang it--_all through_!!" </s>
<s> I begged him, as the choruses are to be put into rehearsal directly the company get together, to let us have, through Mrs Braham, the necessary passports to the stage, which will be forwarded </s>
<s> He leaves town on the _8th of September_ </s>
<s> He will be absent a month, and the first rehearsal will take place immediately on his return; previous to it (I mean the first rehearsal--not the return) I am to read the piece </s>
<s> His only remaining suggestion is, that Miss Rainforth will want another song when the piece is in rehearsal--"a bravura--something in the 'Soldier Tired' way" </s>
<s> We must have a confab about this on Wednesday morning </s>
<s> Harley called in Furnival's Inn, to express his high delight and gratification, but unfortunately we had left town </s>
<s> I shall be at head-quarters by 12 Wednesday noon </s>
<s> Believe me, dear Hullah, Most faithfully yours </s>
<s> P.S.--Tell me on Wednesday when you can come down here, for a day or two </s>
<s> Beautiful place--meadow for exercise, horse for your riding, boat for your rowing, room for your studying--anything you like </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Mr George Hogarth.] [3]13, FURNIVAL'S INN, _Tuesday Evening, January 20th, 1837._ MY DEAR SIR, As you have begged me to write an original sketch for the first number of the new evening paper, and as I trust to your kindness to refer my application to the proper quarter, should I be unreasonably or improperly trespassing upon you, I beg to ask whether it is probable that if I commenced a series of articles, written under some attractive title, for _The Evening Chronicle_, its conductors would think I had any claim to some additional remuneration (of course, of no great amount) for doing so </s>
<s> Let me beg of you not to misunderstand my meaning </s>
<s> Whatever the reply may be, I promised you an article, and shall supply it with the utmost readiness, and with an anxious desire to do my best, which I honestly assure you would be the feeling with which I should always receive any request coming personally from yourself </s>
<s> I merely wish to put it to the proprietors, first, whether a continuation of light papers in the style of my "Street Sketches" would be considered of use to the new paper; and, secondly, if so, whether they do not think it fair and reasonable that, taking my share of the ordinary reporting business of _The Chronicle_ besides, I should receive something for the papers beyond my ordinary salary as a reporter </s>
<s> Begging you to excuse my troubling you, and taking this opportunity of acknowledging the numerous kindnesses I have already received at your hands since I have had the pleasure of acting under you, I am, my dear Sir, very sincerely yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Mrs Hogarth.] DOUGHTY STREET, _Thursday Night, October 26th, 1837._ MY DEAR MRS </s>
<s> HOGARTH, I need not thank you for your present[4] of yesterday, for you know the sorrowful pleasure I shall take in wearing it, and the care with which I shall prize it, until--so far as relates to this life--I am like her </s>
<s> I have never had her ring off my finger by day or night, except for an instant at a time, to wash my hands, since she died </s>
<s> I have never had her sweetness and excellence absent from my mind so long </s>
<s> I can solemnly say that, waking or sleeping, I have never lost the recollection of our hard trial and sorrow, and I feel that I never shall </s>
<s> It will be a great relief to my heart when I find you sufficiently calm upon this sad subject to claim the promise I made you when she lay dead in this house, never to shrink from speaking of her, as if her memory must be avoided, but rather to take a melancholy pleasure in recalling the times when we were all so happy--so happy that increase of fame and prosperity has only widened the gap in my affections, by causing me to think how she would have shared and enhanced all our joys, and how proud I should have been (as God knows I always was) to possess the affections of the gentlest and purest creature that ever shed a light on earth </s>
<s> I wish you could know how I weary now for the three rooms in Furnival's Inn, and how I miss that pleasant smile and those sweet words which, bestowed upon our evening's work, in our merry banterings round the fire, were more precious to me than the applause of a whole world would be </s>
<s> I can recall everything she said and did in those happy days, and could show you every passage and line we read together </s>
<s> I see _now_ how you are capable of making great efforts, even against the afflictions you have to deplore, and I hope that, soon, our words may be where our thoughts are, and that we may call up those old memories, not as shadows of the bitter past, but as lights upon a happier future </s>
<s> Believe me, my dear Mrs Hogarth, Ever truly and affectionately yours </s>

<s> [5]DIARY--1838 </s>
<s> _Monday, January 1st, 1838._ A sad New Year's Day in one respect, for at the opening of last year poor Mary was with us </s>
<s> Very many things to be grateful for since then, however </s>
<s> Increased reputation and means--good health and prospects </s>
<s> We never know the full value of blessings till we lose them (we were not ignorant of this one when we had it, I hope) </s>
<s> But if she were with us now, the same winning, happy, amiable companion, sympathising with all my thoughts and feelings more than anyone I knew ever did or will, I think I should have nothing to wish for, but a continuance of such happiness </s>
<s> But she is gone, and pray God I may one day, through his mercy, rejoin her </s>
<s> I wrote to Mrs Hogarth yesterday, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded me by her sending, as a New Year's token, a pen-wiper of poor Mary's, imploring her, as strongly as I could, to think of the many remaining claims upon her affection and exertions, and not to give way to unavailing grief </s>
<s> Her answer came to-night, and she seems hurt at my doing so--protesting that in all useful respects she is the same as ever </s>
<s> Meant it for the best, and still hope I did right </s>
<s> _Saturday, January 6th, 1838._ Our boy's birthday--one year old </s>
<s> A few people at night--only Forster, the De Gex's, John Ross, Mitton, and the Beards, besides our families--to twelfth-cake and forfeits </s>
<s> This day last year, Mary and I wandered up and down Holborn and the streets about for hours, looking after a little table for Kate's bedroom, which we bought at last at the very first broker's which we had looked into, and which we had passed half-a-dozen times because I _didn't like_ to ask the price </s>
<s> I took her out to Brompton at night, as we had no place for her to sleep in (the two mothers being with us); she came back again next day to keep house for me, and stopped nearly the rest of the month </s>
<s> I shall never be so happy again as in those chambers three storeys high--never if I roll in wealth and fame </s>
<s> I would hire them to keep empty, if I could afford it </s>
<s> _Monday, January 8th, 1838._ I began the "Sketches of Young Gentlemen" to-day </s>
<s> One hundred and twenty-five pounds for such a little book, without my name to it, is pretty well </s>
<s> This and the "Sunday"[6] by-the-bye, are the only two things I have not done as Boz </s>
<s> _Tuesday, January 9th, 1838._ Went to the Sun office to insure my life, where the Board seemed disposed to think I work too much </s>
<s> Made Forster and Pickthorn, my Doctor, the references--and after an interesting interview with the Board and the Board's Doctor, came away to work again </s>
<s> _Wednesday, January 10th, 1838._ At work all day, and to a quadrille party at night </s>
<s> City people and rather dull </s>
<s> Intensely cold coming home, and vague reports of a fire somewhere </s>
<s> Frederick says the Royal Exchange, at which I sneer most sagely; for---- _Thursday, January 11th, 1838._ To-day the papers are full of it, and it _was_ the Royal Exchange, Lloyd's, and all the shops round the building </s>
<s> Called on Browne and went with him to see the ruins, of which we saw as much as we should have done if we had stopped at home </s>
<s> _Sunday, January 14th, 1838._ To church in the morning, and when I came home I wrote the preceding portion of this diary, which henceforth I make a steadfast resolution not to neglect, or _paint_ </s>
<s> I have not done it yet, nor will I; but say what rises to my lips--my mental lips at least--without reserve </s>
<s> No other eyes will see it, while mine are open in life, and although I daresay I shall be ashamed of a good deal in it, I should like to look over it at the year's end </s>
<s> In Scott's diary, which I have been looking at this morning, there are thoughts which have been mine by day and by night, in good spirits and bad, since Mary died </s>
<s> "Another day, and a bright one to the external world again opens on us; the air soft, and the flowers smiling, and the leaves glittering </s>
<s> They cannot refresh her to whom mild weather was a natural enjoyment </s>
<s> Cerements of lead and of wood already hold her; cold earth must have her soon </s>
<s> But it is not </s>

<s> (she) who will be laid among the ruins </s>

<s> She is sentient and conscious of my emotions _somewhere_--where, we cannot tell, how, we cannot tell; yet would I not at this moment renounce the mysterious yet certain hope that I shall see her in a better world, for all that this world can give me </s>
<s> * * * * * "I have seen her </s>
<s> There is the same symmetry of form, though those limbs are rigid which were once so gracefully elastic; but that yellow masque with pinched features, which seems to mock life rather than emulate it, can it be the face that was once so full of lively expression </s>
<s> I will not look upon it again" </s>
<s> I know but too well how true all this is </s>
<s> _Monday, January 15th, 1838._ Here ends this brief attempt at a diary </s>

<s> I am no longer its editor, but I have referred your paper to my successor, and marked it as one "requiring attention" </s>
<s> I have no doubt it will receive it </s>
<s> With reference to your letter bearing date on the 8th of last October, let me assure you that I have delayed answering it--not because a constant stream of similar epistles has rendered me callous to the anxieties of a beginner, in those doubtful paths in which I walk myself--but because you ask me to do that which I would scarce do, of my own unsupported opinion, for my own child, supposing I had one old enough to require such a service </s>
<s> To suppose that I could gravely take upon myself the responsibility of withdrawing you from pursuits you have already undertaken, or urging you on in a most uncertain and hazardous course of life, is really a compliment to my judgment and inflexibility which I cannot recognize and do not deserve (or desire) </s>
<s> I hoped that a little reflection would show you how impossible it is that I could be expected to enter upon a task of so much delicacy, but as you have written to me since, and called (unfortunately at a period when I am obliged to seclude myself from all comers), I am compelled at last to tell you that I can do nothing of the kind </s>
<s> If it be any satisfaction to you to know that I have read what you sent me, and read it with great pleasure, though, as you treat of local matters, I am necessarily in the dark here and there, I can give you the assurance very sincerely </s>
<s> With this, and many thanks to you for your obliging expressions towards myself, I am, Sir, Your very obedient Servant </s>

<s> Harley.] DOUGHTY STREET, _Thursday Morning._[8] MY DEAR HARLEY, This is my birthday </s>
<s> Many happy returns of the day to you and me </s>
<s> I took it into my head yesterday to get up an impromptu dinner on this auspicious occasion--only my own folks, Leigh Hunt, Ainsworth, and Forster </s>
<s> I know you can't dine here in consequence of the tempestuous weather on the Covent Garden shores, but if you will come in when you have done Trinculizing, you will delight me greatly, and add in no inconsiderable degree to the "conviviality" of the meeting </s>
<s> Lord bless my soul </s>
<s> Twenty-seven years old </s>
<s> Who'd have thought it </s>
<s> I _never_ did </s>
<s> But I grow sentimental </s>

<s> You walk up into the first-floor and say (boldly) that you come to sign Mr Charles Dickens's bond--which is already signed by Mr Sergeant Talfourd </s>
<s> I suppose I should formally acquaint you that I have paid the fees, and that the responsibility you incur is a very slight one--extending very little beyond my good behaviour, and honourable intentions to pay for all wine-glasses, tumblers, or other dinner-furniture that I may break or damage </s>
<s> I wish you would do me another service, and that is to choose, at the place you told me of, a reasonable copy of "The Beauties of England and Wales" </s>
<s> You can choose it quite as well as I can, or better, and I shall be much obliged to you </s>
<s> I should like you to send it at once, as I am diving into all kinds of matters at odd minutes with a view to our forthcoming operations </s>

<s> It will afford me real pleasure to hear of your success, for I have many happy recollections connected with Kent, and am scarcely less interested in it than if I had been a Kentish man bred and born, and had resided in the county all my life </s>
<s> Faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Mr Thompson.[11]] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Tuesday, 15th December, 1840._ MY DEAR THOMPSON, I have received a most flattering message from the head turnkey of the jail this morning, intimating that "there warn't a genelman in all London he'd be gladder to show his babies to, than Muster Dickins, and let him come wenever he would to that shop he wos welcome" </s>
<s> But as the Governor (who is a very nice fellow and a gentleman) is not at home this morning, and furthermore as the morning itself has rather gone out of town in respect of its poetical allurements, I think we had best postpone our visit for a day or two </s>

<s> Nor am I the less pleased to receive it, by reason that I cannot find it in my conscience to agree in many important respects with the body to which you belong </s>
<s> In the love of virtue and hatred of vice, in the detestation of cruelty and encouragement of gentleness and mercy, all men who endeavour to be acceptable to their Creator in any way, may freely agree </s>
<s> There are more roads to Heaven, I am inclined to think, than any sect believes; but there can be none which have not these flowers garnishing the way </s>
<s> I feel it a great tribute, therefore, to receive your letter </s>
<s> It is most welcome and acceptable to me </s>
<s> I thank you for it heartily, and am proud of the approval of one who suffered in his youth, even more than my poor child </s>
<s> While you teach in your walk of life the lessons of tenderness you have learnt in sorrow, trust me that in mine, I will pursue cruelty and oppression, the enemies of all God's creatures of all codes and creeds, so long as I have the energy of thought and the power of giving it utterance </s>

<s> So your handwriting last night had as startling an effect upon me, as though you had sealed your note with one of your own eyes </s>
<s> I remember my promise, as in cheerful duty bound, and with Heaven's grace will redeem it </s>
<s> At this moment, I have not the faintest idea how, but I am going into Scotland on the 19th to see Jeffrey, and while I am away (I shall return, please God, in about three weeks) will look out for some accident, incident, or subject for small description, to send you when I come home </s>

<s> I am told that down in Devonshire there are young ladies innumerable, who read crabbed manuscripts with the palms of their hands, and newspapers with their ankles, and so forth; and who are, so to speak, literary all over </s>
<s> I begin to understand what a blue-stocking means, and have not the smallest doubt that Lady ---- (for instance) could write quite as entertaining a book with the sole of her foot as ever she did with her head </s>

<s> There is no living writer, and there are very few among the dead, whose approbation I should feel so proud to earn </s>
<s> And with everything you have written upon my shelves, and in my thoughts, and in my heart of hearts, I may honestly and truly say so </s>
<s> If you could know how earnestly I write this, you would be glad to read it--as I hope you will be, faintly guessing at the warmth of the hand I autobiographically hold out to you over the broad Atlantic </s>
<s> I wish I could find in your welcome letter some hint of an intention to visit England </s>
<s> I can't </s>
<s> I have held it at arm's length, and taken a bird's-eye view of it, after reading it a great many times, but there is no greater encouragement in it this way than on a microscopic inspection </s>
<s> I should love to go with you--as I have gone, God knows how often--into Little Britain, and Eastcheap, and Green Arbour Court, and Westminster Abbey </s>
<s> I should like to travel with you, outside the last of the coaches down to Bracebridge Hall </s>
<s> It would make my heart glad to compare notes with you about that shabby gentleman in the oilcloth hat and red nose, who sat in the nine-cornered back-parlour of the Masons' Arms; and about Robert Preston and the tallow-chandler's widow, whose sitting-room is second nature to me; and about all those delightful places and people that I used to walk about and dream of in the daytime, when a very small and not over-particularly-taken-care-of boy </s>
<s> I have a good deal to say, too, about that dashing Alonzo de Ojeda, that you can't help being fonder of than you ought to be; and much to hear concerning Moorish legend, and poor unhappy Boabdil </s>
<s> Diedrich Knickerbocker I have worn to death in my pocket, and yet I should show you his mutilated carcass with a joy past all expression </s>
<s> I have been so accustomed to associate you with my pleasantest and happiest thoughts, and with my leisure hours, that I rush at once into full confidence with you, and fall, as it were naturally, and by the very laws of gravity, into your open arms </s>
<s> Questions come thronging to my pen as to the lips of people who meet after long hoping to do so </s>
<s> I don't know what to say first or what to leave unsaid, and am constantly disposed to break off and tell you again how glad I am this moment has arrived </s>
<s> My dear Washington Irving, I cannot thank you enough for your cordial and generous praise, or tell you what deep and lasting gratification it has given me </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Professor Felton.] FULLER'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, _Monday, March 14th, 1842._ MY DEAR FELTON,[17] I was more delighted than I can possibly tell you, to receive (last Saturday night) your welcome letter </s>
<s> We and the oysters missed you terribly in New York </s>
<s> You carried away with you more than half the delight and pleasure of my New World; and I heartily wish you could bring it back again </s>
<s> There are very interesting men in this place--highly interesting, of course--but it's not a comfortable place; is it </s>
<s> If spittle could wait at table we should be nobly attended, but as that property has not been imparted to it in the present state of mechanical science, we are rather lonely and orphan-like, in respect of "being looked arter" </s>
<s> A blithe black was introduced on our arrival, as our peculiar and especial attendant </s>
<s> He is the only gentleman in the town who has a peculiar delicacy in intruding upon my valuable time </s>
<s> It usually takes seven rings and a threatening message from ---- to produce him; and when he comes he goes to fetch something, and, forgetting it by the way, comes back no more </s>
<s> We have been in great distress, really in distress, at the non-arrival of the _Caledonia_ </s>
<s> You may conceive what our joy was, when, while we were dining out yesterday, H </s>
<s> arrived with the joyful intelligence of her safety </s>
<s> The very news of her having really arrived seemed to diminish the distance between ourselves and home, by one half at least </s>
<s> And this morning (though we have not yet received our heap of despatches, for which we are looking eagerly forward to this night's mail)--this morning there reached us unexpectedly, through the Government bag (Heaven knows how they came there!), two of our many and long-looked-for letters, wherein was a circumstantial account of the whole conduct and behaviour of our pets; with marvellous narrations of Charley's precocity at a Twelfth Night juvenile party at Macready's; and tremendous predictions of the governess, dimly suggesting his having got out of pot-hooks and hangers, and darkly insinuating the possibility of his writing us a letter before long; and many other workings of the same prophetic spirit, in reference to him and his sisters, very gladdening to their mother's heart, and not at all depressing to their father's </s>
<s> There was, also, the doctor's report, which was a clean bill; and the nurse's report, which was perfectly electrifying; showing as it did how Master Walter had been weaned, and had cut a double tooth, and done many other extraordinary things, quite worthy of his high descent </s>
<s> In short, we were made very happy and grateful; and felt as if the prodigal father and mother had got home again </s>
<s> What do you think of this incendiary card being left at my door last night </s>
<s> "General G </s>
<s> sends compliments to Mr Dickens, and called with two literary ladies </s>
<s> As the two L </s>
<s> L'.s are ambitious of the honour of a personal introduction to Mr D., General G </s>
<s> requests the honour of an appointment for to-morrow" </s>
<s> I draw a veil over my sufferings </s>
<s> They are sacred </s>
<s> We shall be in Buffalo, please Heaven, on the 30th of April </s>
<s> If I don't find a letter from you in the care of the postmaster at that place, I'll never write to you from England </s>
<s> But if I _do_ find one, my right hand shall forget its cunning, before I forget to be your truthful and constant correspondent; not, dear Felton, because I promised it, nor because I have a natural tendency to correspond (which is far from being the case), nor because I am truly grateful to you for, and have been made truly proud by, that affectionate and elegant tribute which ---- sent me, but because you are a man after my own heart, and I love you _well_ </s>
<s> And for the love I bear you, and the pleasure with which I shall always think of you, and the glow I shall feel when I see your handwriting in my own home, I hereby enter into a solemn league and covenant to write as many letters to you as you write to me, at least </s>
<s> Amen </s>
<s> Come to England </s>
<s> Come to England </s>
<s> Our oysters are small, I know; they are said by Americans to be coppery; but our hearts are of the largest size </s>
<s> We are thought to excel in shrimps, to be far from despicable in point of lobsters, and in periwinkles are considered to challenge the universe </s>
<s> Our oysters, small though they be, are not devoid of the refreshing influence which that species of fish is supposed to exercise in these latitudes </s>

<s> Affectionately yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Mr Washington Irving.] WASHINGTON, _Monday Afternoon, March 21st, 1842._ MY DEAR IRVING, We passed through--literally passed through--this place again to-day </s>
<s> I did not come to see you, for I really have not the heart to say "good-bye" again, and felt more than I can tell you when we shook hands last Wednesday </s>
<s> You will not be at Baltimore, I fear </s>
<s> I thought, at the time, that you only said you might be there, to make our parting the gayer </s>
<s> Wherever you go, God bless you </s>
<s> What pleasure I have had in seeing and talking with you, I will not attempt to say </s>
<s> I shall never forget it as long as I live </s>
<s> What would I give, if we could have but a quiet week together </s>
<s> Spain is a lazy place, and its climate an indolent one </s>
<s> But if you have ever leisure under its sunny skies to think of a man who loves you, and holds communion with your spirit oftener, perhaps, than any other person alive--leisure from listlessness, I mean--and will write to me in London, you will give me an inexpressible amount of pleasure </s>
<s> Your affectionate friend </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Professor Felton.] MONTREAL, _Saturday, 21st May, 1842._ MY DEAR FELTON, I was delighted to receive your letter yesterday, and was well pleased with its contents </s>
<s> I anticipated objection to Carlyle's[18] letter </s>
<s> I called particular attention to it for three reasons </s>
<s> Firstly, because he boldly _said_ what all the others _think_, and therefore deserved to be manfully supported </s>
<s> Secondly, because it is my deliberate opinion that I have been assailed on this subject in a manner in which no man with any pretensions to public respect or with the remotest right to express an opinion on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed in any other country </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> I really cannot sufficiently thank you, dear Felton, for your warm and hearty interest in these proceedings </s>
<s> But it would be idle to pursue that theme, so let it pass </s>
<s> The wig and whiskers are in a state of the highest preservation </s>
<s> The play comes off next Wednesday night, the 25th </s>
<s> What would I give to see you in the front row of the centre box, your spectacles gleaming not unlike those of my dear friend Pickwick, your face radiant with as broad a grin as a staid professor may indulge in, and your very coat, waistcoat, and shoulders expressive of what we should take together when the performance was over </s>
<s> I would give something (not so much, but still a good round sum) if you could only stumble into that very dark and dusty theatre in the daytime (at any minute between twelve and three), and see me with my coat off, the stage manager and universal director, urging impracticable ladies and impossible gentlemen on to the very confines of insanity, shouting and driving about, in my own person, to an extent which would justify any philanthropic stranger in clapping me into a strait-waistcoat without further inquiry, endeavouring to goad H </s>
<s> into some dim and faint understanding of a prompter's duties, and struggling in such a vortex of noise, dirt, bustle, confusion, and inextricable entanglement of speech and action as you would grow giddy in contemplating </s>
<s> We perform "A Roland for an Oliver," "A Good Night's Rest," and "Deaf as a Post" </s>
<s> This kind of voluntary hard labour used to be my great delight </s>
<s> The _furor_ has come strong upon me again, and I begin to be once more of opinion that nature intended me for the lessee of a national theatre, and that pen, ink, and paper have spoiled a manager </s>
<s> Oh, how I look forward across that rolling water to home and its small tenantry </s>
<s> How I busy myself in thinking how my books look, and where the tables are, and in what positions the chairs stand relatively to the other furniture; and whether we shall get there in the night, or in the morning, or in the afternoon; and whether we shall be able to surprise them, or whether they will be too sharply looking out for us; and what our pets will say; and how they'll look, and who will be the first to come and shake hands, and so forth </s>
<s> If I could but tell you how I have set my heart on rushing into Forster's study (he is my great friend, and writes at the bottom of all his letters: "My love to Felton"), and into Maclise's painting-room, and into Macready's managerial ditto, without a moment's warning, and how I picture every little trait and circumstance of our arrival to myself, down to the very colour of the bow on the cook's cap, you would almost think I had changed places with my eldest son, and was still in pantaloons of the thinnest texture </s>
<s> I left all these things--God only knows what a love I have for them--as coolly and calmly as any animated cucumber; but when I come upon them again I shall have lost all power of self-restraint, and shall as certainly make a fool of myself (in the popular meaning of that expression) as ever Grimaldi did in his way, or George the Third in his </s>
<s> And not the less so, dear Felton, for having found some warm hearts, and left some instalments of earnest and sincere affection, behind me on this continent </s>
<s> And whenever I turn my mental telescope hitherward, trust me that one of the first figures it will descry will wear spectacles so like yours that the maker couldn't tell the difference, and shall address a Greek class in such an exact imitation of your voice, that the very students hearing it should cry, "That's he </s>
<s> Three cheers </s>
<s> Hoo-ray-ay-ay-ay-ay" </s>
<s> About those joints of yours, I think you are mistaken </s>
<s> They _can't_ be stiff </s>
<s> At the worst they merely want the air of New York, which, being impregnated with the flavour of last year's oysters, has a surprising effect in rendering the human frame supple and flexible in all cases of rust </s>
<s> A terrible idea occurred to me as I wrote those words </s>
<s> The oyster-cellars--what do they do when oysters are not in season </s>
<s> Is pickled salmon vended there </s>
<s> Do they sell crabs, shrimps, winkles, herrings </s>
<s> The oyster-openers--what do _they_ do </s>
<s> Do they commit suicide in despair, or wrench open tight drawers and cupboards and hermetically-sealed bottles for practice </s>
<s> Perhaps they are dentists out of the oyster season </s>
<s> Who knows </s>
<s> Affectionately yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] 1, DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, YORK GATE, REGENT'S PARK, LONDON, _Sunday, July 31st, 1842._ MY DEAR FELTON, Of all the monstrous and incalculable amount of occupation that ever beset one unfortunate man, mine has been the most stupendous since I came home </s>
<s> The dinners I have had to eat, the places I have had to go to, the letters I have had to answer, the sea of business and of pleasure in which I have been plunged, not even the genius of an ---- or the pen of a ---- could describe </s>
<s> Wherefore I indite a monstrously short and wildly uninteresting epistle to the American Dando; but perhaps you don't know who Dando was </s>
<s> He was an oyster-eater, my dear Felton </s>
<s> He used to go into oyster-shops, without a farthing of money, and stand at the counter eating natives, until the man who opened them grew pale, cast down his knife, staggered backward, struck his white forehead with his open hand, and cried, "You are Dando!!" </s>
<s> He has been known to eat twenty dozen at one sitting, and would have eaten forty, if the truth had not flashed upon the shopkeeper </s>
<s> For these offences he was constantly committed to the House of Correction </s>
<s> During his last imprisonment he was taken ill, got worse and worse, and at last began knocking violent double knocks at Death's door </s>
<s> The doctor stood beside his bed, with his fingers on his pulse </s>
<s> "He is going," says the doctor </s>
<s> "I see it in his eye </s>
<s> There is only one thing that would keep life in him for another hour, and that is--oysters" </s>
<s> They were immediately brought </s>
<s> Dando swallowed eight, and feebly took a ninth </s>
<s> He held it in his mouth and looked round the bed strangely </s>
<s> "Not a bad one, is it" </s>
<s> says the doctor </s>
<s> The patient shook his head, rubbed his trembling hand upon his stomach, bolted the oyster, and fell back--dead </s>
<s> They buried him in the prison-yard, and paved his grave with oyster-shells </s>
<s> We are all well and hearty, and have already begun to wonder what time next year you and Mrs Felton and Dr </s>
<s> Howe will come across the briny sea together </s>
<s> To-morrow we go to the seaside for two months </s>

<s> For the first time within the memory of man, the professors of English literature seem disposed to act together on this question </s>

<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> I wish you had been at Greenwich the other day, where a party of friends gave me a private dinner; public ones I have refused </s>
<s> C---- was perfectly wild at the reunion, and, after singing all manner of marine songs, wound up the entertainment by coming home (six miles) in a little open phaeton of mine, _on his head_, to the mingled delight and indignation of the metropolitan police </s>
<s> We were very jovial indeed; and I assure you that I drank your health with fearful vigour and energy </s>
<s> On board that ship coming home I established a club, called the United Vagabonds, to the large amusement of the rest of the passengers </s>
<s> This holy brotherhood committed all kinds of absurdities, and dined always, with a variety of solemn forms, at one end of the table, below the mast, away from all the rest </s>
<s> The captain being ill when we were three or four days out, I produced my medicine-chest and recovered him </s>
<s> We had a few more sick men after that, and I went round "the wards" every day in great state, accompanied by two Vagabonds, habited as Ben Allen and Bob Sawyer, bearing enormous rolls of plaster and huge pairs of scissors </s>

<s> A piece of salmon and a steak are cooking in the kitchen; it's a very wet day, and I have had a fire lighted; the wine sparkles on a side table; the room looks the more snug from being the only _un_dismantled one in the house; plates are warming for Forster and Maclise, whose knock I am momentarily expecting; that groom I told you of, who never comes into the house, except when we are all out of town, is walking about in his shirt-sleeves without the smallest consciousness of impropriety; a great mound of proofs are waiting to be read aloud, after dinner </s>
<s> With what a shout I would clap you down into the easiest chair, my genial Felton, if you could but appear, and order you a pair of slippers instantly </s>
<s> Since I have written this, the aforesaid groom--a very small man (as the fashion is), with fiery red hair (as the fashion is _not_)--has looked very hard at me and fluttered about me at the same time, like a giant butterfly </s>
<s> After a pause, he says, in a Sam Wellerish kind of way: "I vent to the club this mornin', sir </s>

<s> "Pretty well, Topping" </s>

<s> "No, sir, she's a goin', sir, to have a hincrease wery soon, and it makes her rather nervous, sir; and ven a young voman gets at all down at sich a time, sir, she goes down wery deep, sir" </s>
<s> To this sentiment I replied affirmatively, and then he adds, as he stirs the fire (as if he were thinking out loud): "Wot a mystery it is </s>
<s> Wot a go is natur'" </s>
<s> With which scrap of philosophy, he gradually gets nearer to the door, and so fades out of the room </s>
<s> This same man asked me one day, soon after I came home, what Sir John Wilson was </s>

<s> I told him an officer </s>
<s> "A wot, sir" </s>
<s> "An officer" </s>
<s> And then, for fear he should think I meant a police-officer, I added, "An officer in the army" </s>
<s> "I beg your pardon, sir," he said, touching his hat, "but the club as I always drove him to wos the United Servants" </s>
<s> The real name of this club is the United Service, but I have no doubt he thought it was a high-life-below-stairs kind of resort, and that this gentleman was a retired butler or superannuated footman </s>

<s> The American book (to begin with that) has been a most complete and thorough-going success </s>
<s> Four large editions have now been sold _and paid for_, and it has won golden opinions from all sorts of men, except our friend in F----, who is a miserable creature; a disappointed man in great poverty, to whom I have ever been most kind and considerate (I need scarcely say that); and another friend in B----, no less a person than an illustrious gentleman named ----, who wrote a story called ---- </s>

<s> The "we" means Forster, Maclise, Stanfield (the renowned marine painter), and the Inimitable Boz </s>
<s> We went down into Devonshire by the railroad, and there we hired an open carriage from an innkeeper, patriotic in all Pickwick matters, and went on with post-horses </s>
<s> Sometimes we travelled all night, sometimes all day, sometimes both </s>
<s> I kept the joint-stock purse, ordered all the dinners, paid all the turnpikes, conducted facetious conversations with the post-boys, and regulated the pace at which we travelled </s>
<s> Stanfield (an old sailor) consulted an enormous map on all disputed points of wayfaring; and referred, moreover, to a pocket-compass and other scientific instruments </s>
<s> The luggage was in Forster's department; and Maclise, having nothing particular to do, sang songs </s>
<s> Heavens </s>
<s> If you could have seen the necks of bottles--distracting in their immense varieties of shape--peering out of the carriage pockets </s>
<s> If you could have witnessed the deep devotion of the post-boys, the wild attachment of the hostlers, the maniac glee of the waiters </s>
<s> If you could have followed us into the earthy old churches we visited, and into the strange caverns on the gloomy sea-shore, and down into the depths of mines, and up to the tops of giddy heights where the unspeakably green water was roaring, I don't know how many hundred feet below </s>
<s> If you could have seen but one gleam of the bright fires by which we sat in the big rooms of ancient inns at night, until long after the small hours had come and gone, or smelt but one steam of the hot punch (not white, dear Felton, like that amazing compound I sent you a taste of, but a rich, genial, glowing brown) which came in every evening in a huge broad china bowl </s>
<s> I never laughed in my life as I did on this journey </s>
<s> It would have done you good to hear me </s>
<s> I was choking and gasping and bursting the buckle off the back of my stock, all the way </s>
<s> And Stanfield (who is very much of your figure and temperament, but fifteen years older) got into such apoplectic entanglements that we were often obliged to beat him on the back with portmanteaus before we could recover him </s>
<s> Seriously, I do believe there never was such a trip </s>
<s> And they made such sketches, those two men, in the most romantic of our halting-places, that you would have sworn we had the Spirit of Beauty with us, as well as the Spirit of Fun </s>
<s> But stop till you come to England--I say no more </s>
<s> The actuary of the national debt couldn't calculate the number of children who are coming here on Twelfth Night, in honour of Charley's birthday, for which occasion I have provided a magic lantern and divers other tremendous engines of that nature </s>
<s> But the best of it is that Forster and I have purchased between us the entire stock-in-trade of a conjurer, the practice and display whereof is intrusted to me </s>
<s> And O my dear eyes, Felton, if you could see me conjuring the company's watches into impossible tea-caddies, and causing pieces of money to fly, and burning pocket-handkerchiefs without hurting 'em, and practising in my own room, without anybody to admire, you would never forget it as long as you live </s>
<s> In those tricks which require a confederate, I am assisted (by reason of his imperturbable good humour) by Stanfield, who always does his part exactly the wrong way, to the unspeakable delight of all beholders </s>

<s> Particulars shall be forwarded in my next </s>
<s> I have quite made up my mind that F---- really believes he _does_ know you personally, and has all his life </s>
<s> He talks to me about you with such gravity that I am afraid to grin, and feel it necessary to look quite serious </s>
<s> Sometimes he _tells_ me things about you, doesn't ask me, you know, so that I am occasionally perplexed beyond all telling, and begin to think it was he, and not I, who went to America </s>
<s> It's the queerest thing in the world </s>
<s> The book I was to have given Longfellow for you is not worth sending by itself, being only a Barnaby </s>
<s> But I will look up some manuscript for you (I think I have that of the American Notes complete), and will try to make the parcel better worth its long conveyance </s>
<s> With regard to Maclise's pictures, you certainly are quite right in your impression of them; but he is "such a discursive devil" (as he says about himself) and flies off at such odd tangents, that I feel it difficult to convey to you any general notion of his purpose </s>

<s> And though I care very little for the opinion of any person who will set the statement of an American editor (almost invariably an atrocious scoundrel) against my character and conduct, such as they may be; still, my sense of justice does revolt from this most cavalier and careless exhibition of me to a whole people, as a traveller under false pretences, and a disappointed intriguer </s>
<s> The better the acquaintance with America, the more defenceless and more inexcusable such conduct is </s>
<s> For, I solemnly declare (and appeal to any man but the writer of this paper, who has travelled in that country, for confirmation of my statement) that the source from which he drew the "information" so recklessly put forth again in England, is infinitely more obscene, disgusting, and brutal than the very worst Sunday newspaper that has ever been printed in Great Britain </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Professor Felton.] 1, DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, YORK GATE, REGENT'S PARK, LONDON, _March 2nd, 1843._ MY DEAR FELTON, I don't know where to begin, but plunge headlong with a terrible splash into this letter, on the chance of turning up somewhere </s>
<s> Hurrah </s>
<s> Up like a cork again, with _The North American Review_ in my hand </s>
<s> Like you, my dear ----, and I can say no more in praise of it, though I go on to the end of the sheet </s>
<s> You cannot think how much notice it has attracted here </s>
<s> Brougham called the other day, with the number (thinking I might not have seen it), and I being out at the time, he left a note, speaking of it, and of the writer, in terms that warmed my heart </s>
<s> Lord Ashburton (one of whose people wrote a notice in the _Edinburgh_ which they have since publicly contradicted) also wrote to me about it in just the same strain </s>
<s> And many others have done the like </s>
<s> I am in great health and spirits and powdering away at Chuzzlewit, with all manner of facetiousness rising up before me as I go on </s>
<s> As to news, I have really none, saving that ---- (who never took any exercise in his life) has been laid up with rheumatism for weeks past, but is now, I hope, getting better </s>
<s> My little captain, as I call him--he who took me out, I mean, and with whom I had that adventure of the cork soles--has been in London too, and seeing all the lions under my escort </s>
<s> Good heavens </s>
<s> I wish you could have seen certain other mahogany-faced men (also captains) who used to call here for him in the morning, and bear him off to docks and rivers and all sorts of queer places, whence he always returned late at night, with rum-and-water tear-drops in his eyes, and a complication of punchy smells in his mouth </s>
<s> He was better than a comedy to us, having marvellous ways of tying his pocket-handkerchief round his neck at dinner-time in a kind of jolly embarrassment, and then forgetting what he had done with it; also of singing songs to wrong tunes, and calling land objects by sea names, and never knowing what o'clock it was, but taking midnight for seven in the evening; with many other sailor oddities, all full of honesty, manliness, and good temper </s>
<s> We took him to Drury Lane Theatre to see "Much Ado About Nothing" </s>
<s> But I never could find out what he meant by turning round, after he had watched the first two scenes with great attention, and inquiring "whether it was a Polish piece" </s>

<s> On the 4th of April I am going to preside at a public dinner for the benefit of the printers; and if you were a guest at that table, wouldn't I smite you on the shoulder, harder than ever I rapped the well-beloved back of Washington Irving at the City Hotel in New York </s>
<s> You were asking me--I love to say asking, as if we could talk together--about Maclise </s>
<s> He is such a discursive fellow, and so eccentric in his might, that on a mental review of his pictures I can hardly tell you of them as leading to any one strong purpose </s>
<s> But the annual Exhibition of the Royal Academy comes off in May, and then I will endeavour to give you some notion of him </s>
<s> He is a tremendous creature, and might do anything </s>

<s> Ah </s>
<s> I saw a scene of mingled comicality and seriousness at his funeral some weeks ago, which has choked me at dinner-time ever since </s>
<s> C---- and I went as mourners; and as he lived, poor fellow, five miles out of town, I drove C---- down </s>
<s> It was such a day as I hope, for the credit of nature, is seldom seen in any parts but these--muddy, foggy, wet, dark, cold, and unutterably wretched in every possible respect </s>
<s> Now, C---- has enormous whiskers, which straggle all down his throat in such weather, and stick out in front of him, like a partially unravelled bird's-nest; so that he looks queer enough at the best, but when he is very wet, and in a state between jollity (he is always very jolly with me) and the deepest gravity (going to a funeral, you know), it is utterly impossible to resist him; especially as he makes the strangest remarks the mind of man can conceive, without any intention of being funny, but rather meaning to be philosophical </s>
<s> I really cried with an irresistible sense of his comicality all the way; but when he was dressed out in a black cloak and a very long black hat-band by an undertaker (who, as he whispered me with tears in his eyes--for he had known H---- many years--was a "character, and he would like to sketch him"), I thought I should have been obliged to go away </s>
<s> However, we went into a little parlour where the funeral party was, and God knows it was miserable enough, for the widow and children were crying bitterly in one corner, and the other mourners--mere people of ceremony, who cared no more for the dead man than the hearse did--were talking quite coolly and carelessly together in another; and the contrast was as painful and distressing as anything I ever saw </s>
<s> There was an Independent clergyman present, with his bands on and a bible under his arm, who, as soon as we were seated, addressed ---- thus, in a loud emphatic voice: "Mr C----, have you seen a paragraph respecting our departed friend, which has gone the round of the morning papers" </s>
<s> "Yes, sir," says C----, "I have," looking very hard at me the while, for he had told me with some pride coming down that it was his composition </s>
<s> "Oh" </s>
<s> said the clergyman </s>
<s> "Then you will agree with me, Mr C----, that it is not only an insult to me, who am the servant of the Almighty, but an insult to the Almighty, whose servant I am" </s>
<s> "How is that, sir" </s>
<s> said C---- </s>
<s> "It is stated, Mr C----, in that paragraph," says the minister, "that when Mr H---- failed in business as a bookseller, he was persuaded by _me_ to try the pulpit; which is false, incorrect, unchristian, in a manner blasphemous, and in all respects contemptible </s>
<s> Let us pray" </s>
<s> With which, my dear Felton, and in the same breath, I give you my word, he knelt down, as we all did, and began a very miserable jumble of an extemporary prayer </s>
<s> I was really penetrated with sorrow for the family, but when C---- (upon his knees, and sobbing for the loss of an old friend) whispered me, "that if that wasn't a clergyman, and it wasn't a funeral, he'd have punched his head," I felt as if nothing but convulsions could possibly relieve me </s>

<s> The best portrait that was ever painted would be of little value to you and me, in comparison with that unfading picture we have within us; and of the worst (which ----'s really is) I can only say, that it has no interest in my eyes, beyond being something which she sat near in its progress, full of life and beauty </s>
<s> In that light, I set some store by the copy you have sent me; and as a mark of your affection, I need not say I value it very much </s>
<s> As any record of that dear face, it is utterly worthless </s>
<s> I trace in many respects a strong resemblance between her mental features and Georgina's--so strange a one, at times, that when she and Kate and I are sitting together, I seem to think that what has happened is a melancholy dream from which I am just awakening </s>
<s> The perfect like of what she was, will never be again, but so much of her spirit shines out in this sister, that the old time comes back again at some seasons, and I can hardly separate it from the present </s>
<s> After she died, I dreamed of her every night for many months--I think for the better part of a year--sometimes as a spirit, sometimes as a living creature, never with any of the bitterness of my real sorrow, but always with a kind of quiet happiness, which became so pleasant to me that I never lay down at night without a hope of the vision coming back in one shape or other </s>
<s> And so it did </s>
<s> I went down into Yorkshire, and finding it still present to me, in a strange scene and a strange bed, I could not help mentioning the circumstance in a note I wrote home to Kate </s>
<s> From that moment I have never dreamed of her once, though she is so much in my thoughts at all times (especially when I am successful, and have prospered in anything) that the recollection of her is an essential part of my being, and is as inseparable from my existence as the beating of my heart is </s>

<s> This is a little fishing-place; intensely quiet; built on a cliff, whereon--in the centre of a tiny semicircular bay--our house stands; the sea rolling and dashing under the windows </s>
<s> Seven miles out are the Goodwin Sands (you've heard of the Goodwin Sands?) whence floating lights perpetually wink after dark, as if they were carrying on intrigues with the servants </s>
<s> Also there is a big lighthouse called the North Foreland on a hill behind the village, a severe parsonic light, which reproves the young and giddy floaters, and stares grimly out upon the sea </s>

<s> Other old gentlemen look all day through telescopes and never see anything </s>

<s> His name is Boz </s>
<s> At one he disappears, and presently emerges from a bathing-machine, and may be seen--a kind of salmon-coloured porpoise--splashing about in the ocean </s>
<s> After that he may be seen in another bay-window on the ground-floor, eating a strong lunch; after that, walking a dozen miles or so, or lying on his back in the sand reading a book </s>
<s> Nobody bothers him unless they know he is disposed to be talked to; and I am told he is very comfortable indeed </s>
<s> He's as brown as a berry, and they _do_ say is a small fortune to the innkeeper who sells beer and cold punch </s>
<s> But this is mere rumour </s>
<s> Sometimes he goes up to London (eighty miles, or so, away), and then I'm told there is a sound in Lincoln's Inn Fields at night, as of men laughing, together with a clinking of knives and forks and wine-glasses </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Mr Macvey Napier.] BROADSTAIRS, _September 16th, 1843._ MY DEAR SIR, I hinted, in a letter of introduction I gave Mr Hood to you, that I had been thinking of a subject for the _Edinburgh_ </s>
<s> Would it meet the purposes of the _Review_ to come out strongly against any system of education based exclusively on the principles of the Established Church </s>
<s> If it would, I should like to show why such a thing as the Church Catechism is wholly inapplicable to the state of ignorance that now prevails; and why no system but one, so general in great religious principles as to include all creeds, can meet the wants and understandings of the dangerous classes of society </s>
<s> This is the only broad ground I could hold, consistently with what I feel and think on such a subject </s>
<s> But I could give, in taking it, a description of certain voluntary places of instruction, called "the ragged schools," now existing in London, and of the schools in jails, and of the ignorance presented in such places, which would make a very striking paper, especially if they were put in strong comparison with the effort making, by subscription, to maintain exclusive Church instruction </s>
<s> I could show these people in a state so miserable and so neglected, that their very nature rebels against the simplest religion, and that to convey to them the faintest outlines of any system of distinction between right and wrong is in itself a giant's task, before which mysteries and squabbles for forms _must_ give way </s>
<s> Would this be too much for the _Review_ </s>
<s> Faithfully yours </s>

<s> Don't believe them </s>
<s> I have written you, in intention, fifty letters, and I can claim no credit for anyone of them (though they were the best letters you ever read), for they all originated in my desire to live in your memory and regard </s>
<s> Since I heard from Count D'Orsay, I have been beset in I don't know how many ways </s>
<s> First of all, I went to Marseilles and came back to Genoa </s>
<s> Then I moved to the Peschiere </s>
<s> Then some people, who had been present at the Scientific Congress here, made a sudden inroad on that establishment, and overran it </s>
<s> Then they went away, and I shut myself up for a month, close and tight, over my little Christmas book, "The Chimes" </s>
<s> All my affections and passions got twined and knotted up in it, and I became as haggard as a murderer, long before I wrote "The End" </s>
<s> When I had done that, like "_The_ man of Thessaly," who having scratched his eyes out in a quickset hedge, plunged into a bramble-bush to scratch them in again, I fled to Venice, to recover the composure I had disturbed </s>
<s> From thence I went to Verona and to Mantua </s>
<s> And now I am here--just come up from underground, and earthy all over, from seeing that extraordinary tomb in which the dead saint lies in an alabaster case, with sparkling jewels all about him to mock his dusty eyes, not to mention the twenty-franc pieces which devout votaries were ringing down upon a sort of sky-light in the cathedral pavement above, as if it were the counter of his heavenly shop </s>
<s> You know Verona </s>
<s> You know everything in Italy, _I_ know </s>
<s> The Roman Amphitheatre there delighted me beyond expression </s>
<s> I never saw anything so full of solemn ancient interest </s>
<s> There are the four-and-forty rows of seats, as fresh and perfect as if their occupants had vacated them but yesterday--the entrances, passages, dens, rooms, corridors, the numbers over some of the arches </s>
<s> An equestrian troop had been there some days before, and had scooped out a little ring at one end of the arena, and had their performances in that spot </s>
<s> I should like to have seen it, of all things, for its very dreariness </s>
<s> Fancy a handful of people sprinkled over one corner of the great place (the whole population of Verona wouldn't fill it now); and a spangled cavalier bowing to the echoes, and the grass-grown walls </s>
<s> I climbed to the topmost seat, and looked away at the beautiful view for some minutes; when I turned round, and looked down into the theatre again, it had exactly the appearance of an immense straw hat, to which the helmet in the Castle of Otranto was a baby; the rows of seats representing the different plaits of straw, and the arena the inside of the crown </s>
<s> I had great expectations of Venice, but they fell immeasurably short of the wonderful reality </s>
<s> The short time I passed there went by me in a dream </s>
<s> I hardly think it possible to exaggerate its beauties, its sources of interest, its uncommon novelty and freshness </s>
<s> A thousand and one realisations of the Thousand and one Nights, could scarcely captivate and enchant me more than Venice </s>
<s> Your old house at Albaro--Il Paradiso--is spoken of as yours to this day </s>
<s> What a gallant place it is </s>
<s> I don't know the present inmate, but I hear that he bought and furnished it not long since, with great splendour, in the French style, and that he wishes to sell it </s>
<s> I wish I were rich and could buy it </s>
<s> There is a third-rate wine shop below Byron's house, and the place looks dull and miserable, and ruinous enough </s>
<s> Old ---- is a trifle uglier than when I first arrived </s>
<s> He has periodical parties, at which there are a great many flowerpots and a few ices--no other refreshments </s>
<s> He goes about, constantly charged with extemporaneous poetry, and is always ready, like tavern dinners, on the shortest notice and the most reasonable terms </s>
<s> He keeps a gigantic harp in his bedroom, together with pen, ink, and paper, for fixing his ideas as they flow, a kind of profane King David, but truly good-natured and very harmless </s>
<s> Pray say to Count D'Orsay everything that is cordial and loving from me </s>
<s> The travelling purse he gave me has been of immense service </s>
<s> It has been constantly opened </s>
<s> All Italy seems to yearn to put its hand in it </s>
<s> I think of hanging it, when I come back to England, on a nail as a trophy, and of gashing the brim like the blade of an old sword, and saying to my son and heir, as they do upon the stage: "You see this notch, boy </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Mr Macvey Napier.] 1, DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _July 28th, 1845._ MY DEAR SIR, As my note is to bear reference to business, I will make it as short and plain as I can </s>
<s> I think I could write a pretty good and a well-timed article on the _Punishment of Death_, and sympathy with great criminals, instancing the gross and depraved curiosity that exists in reference to them, by some of the outrageous things that were written, done, and said in recent cases </s>
<s> But as I am not sure that my views would be yours, and as their statement would be quite inseparable from such a paper, I will briefly set down their purport that you may decide for yourself </s>
<s> Society, having arrived at that state in which it spares bodily torture to the worst criminals, and having agreed, if criminals be put to death at all, to kill them in the speediest way, I consider the question with reference to society, and not at all with reference to the criminal, holding that, in a case of cruel and deliberate murder, he is already mercifully and sparingly treated </s>
<s> But, as a question for the deliberate consideration of all reflective persons, I put this view of the case </s>
<s> With such very repulsive and odious details before us, may it not be well to inquire whether the punishment of death be beneficial to society </s>
<s> I believe it to have a horrible fascination for many of those persons who render themselves liable to it, impelling them onward to the acquisition of a frightful notoriety; and (setting aside the strong confirmation of this idea afforded in individual instances) I presume this to be the case in very badly regulated minds, when I observe the strange fascination which everything connected with this punishment, or the object of it, possesses for tens of thousands of decent, virtuous, well-conducted people, who are quite unable to resist the published portraits, letters, anecdotes, smilings, snuff-takings, of the bloodiest and most unnatural scoundrel with the gallows before him </s>
<s> I observe that this strange interest does not prevail to anything like the same degree where death is not the penalty </s>
<s> Therefore I connect it with the dread and mystery surrounding death in any shape, but especially in this avenging form, and am disposed to come to the conclusion that it produces crime in the criminally disposed, and engenders a diseased sympathy--morbid and bad, but natural and often irresistible--among the well-conducted and gentle </s>
<s> Regarding it as doing harm to both these classes, it may even then be right to inquire, whether it has any salutary influence on those small knots and specks of people, mere bubbles in the living ocean, who actually behold its infliction with their proper eyes </s>
<s> On this head it is scarcely possible to entertain a doubt, for we know that robbery, and obscenity, and callous indifference are of no commoner occurrence anywhere than at the foot of the scaffold </s>
<s> Furthermore, we know that all exhibitions of agony and death have a tendency to brutalise and harden the feelings of men, and have always been the most rife among the fiercest people </s>
<s> Again, it is a great question whether ignorant and dissolute persons (ever the great body of spectators, as few others will attend), seeing _that_ murder done, and not having seen the other, will not, almost of necessity, sympathise with the man who dies before them, especially as he is shown, a martyr to their fancy, tied and bound, alone among scores, with every kind of odds against him </s>
<s> I should take all these threads up at the end by a vivid little sketch of the origin and progress of such a crime as Hooker's, stating a somewhat parallel case, but an imaginary one, pursuing its hero to his death, and showing what enormous harm he does _after_ the crime for which he suffers </s>
<s> I should state none of these positions in a positive sledge-hammer way, but tempt and lure the reader into the discussion of them in his own mind; and so we come to this at last--whether it be for the benefit of society to elevate even this crime to the awful dignity and notoriety of death; and whether it would not be much more to its advantage to substitute a mean and shameful punishment, degrading the deed and the committer of the deed, and leaving the general compassion to expend itself upon the only theme at present quite forgotten in the history, that is to say, the murdered person </s>

<s> It is merely an exposition of the inferences to which its whole philosophy must tend </s>

<s> He has been now at Versailles, now in the prisons, now at the opera, now at the hospitals, now at the Conservatoire, and now at the Morgue, with a dreadful insatiability </s>
<s> I begin to doubt whether I had anything to do with a book called "Dombey," or ever sat over number five (not finished a fortnight yet) day after day, until I half began, like the monk in poor Wilkie's story, to think it the only reality in life, and to mistake all the realities for short-lived shadows </s>
<s> Among the multitude of sights, we saw our pleasant little bud of a friend, Rose Chéri, play Clarissa Harlowe the other night </s>
<s> I believe she does it in London just now, and perhaps you may have seen it </s>

<s> The party of amateurs connected with literature and art, who acted in London two years ago, have resolved to play again at one of the large theatres here for the benefit of Leigh Hunt, and to make a great appeal to all classes of society in behalf of a writer who should have received long ago, but has not yet, some enduring return from his country for all he has undergone and all the good he has done </s>
<s> It is believed that such a demonstration by literature on behalf of literature, and such a mark of sympathy by authors and artists, for one who has written so well, would be of more service, present and prospective, to Hunt than almost any other means of help that could be devised </s>
<s> And we know, from himself, that it would be most gratifying to his own feelings </s>
<s> The arrangements are, as yet, in an imperfect state; for the date of their being carried out depends on our being able to get one of the large theatres before the close of the present London season </s>
<s> In the event of our succeeding, we purpose acting in London, on Wednesday the 14th of July, and on Monday the 19th </s>
<s> On the first occasion we shall play "Every Man in His Humour," and a farce; on the second, "The Merry Wives of Windsor," and a farce </s>
<s> But we do not intend to stop here </s>
<s> Believing that Leigh Hunt has done more to instruct the young men of England, and to lend a helping hand to those who educate themselves, than any writer in England, we are resolved to come down, in a body, to Liverpool and Manchester, and to act one night at each place </s>
<s> And the object of my letter is, to ask you, as the representative of the great educational establishment of Liverpool, whether we can count on your active assistance; whether you will form a committee to advance our object; and whether, if we send you our circulars and addresses, you will endeavour to secure us a full theatre, and to enlist the general sympathy and interest in behalf of the cause we have at heart </s>
<s> I address, by this post, a letter, which is almost the counterpart of the present, to the honorary secretaries of the Manchester Athenæum </s>
<s> If we find in both towns such a response as we confidently expect, I would propose, on behalf of my friends, that the Liverpool and Manchester Institutions should decide for us, at which town we shall first appear, and which play we shall act in each place </s>

<s> I cannot praise it better or more appropriately than by saying it is in Hunt's own spirit, and most charmingly expressed </s>
<s> I had the most sincere and hearty pleasure in reading it.[34] Your announcement of "The Working Man's Life" had attracted my attention by reason of the title, which had a great interest for me.[35] I hardly know if there is something wanting to my fancy in a certain genuine simple air I had looked for in the first part </s>
<s> But there is great promise in it, and I shall be earnest to know how it proceeds </s>

<s> I have written to Mr Robinson by this post that I wish these words, from our original London circular, to stand at top of the bills, after "For the Benefit of Mr Leigh Hunt": "It is proposed to devote a portion of the proceeds of this benefit to the assistance of another celebrated writer, whose literary career is at an end, and who has no provision for the decline of his life" </s>
<s> I have also told him that there is no objection to its being known that this is Mr Poole, the author of "Paul Pry," and "Little Pedlington," and many comic pieces of great merit, and whose farce of "Turning the Tables" we mean to finish with in Manchester </s>
<s> Beyond what he will get from these benefits, he has no resource in this wide world, _I know_ </s>

<s> And will you let me suggest another point for your consideration </s>
<s> On the night when "The Merry Wives" will _not_ be played, and when "Every Man in his Humour" _will_ be, Kenny's farce of "Love, Law, and Physic" will be acted </s>
<s> In that farce there is a very good character (one Mrs Hilary, which I have seen Mrs Orger, I think, act to admiration), that would have been played by Mrs C </s>

<s> If you find yourself quite comfortable and at ease among us, in Mrs Quickly, would you like to take this other part too </s>
<s> It is an excellent farce, and is safe, I hope, to be very well done </s>
<s> We do not play to purchase the house[37] (which may be positively considered as paid for), but towards endowing a perpetual curatorship of it, for some eminent literary veteran </s>

<s> _If yes, would you and our other friends go, at once, to work in the cause?_ The only night on which we could play in Manchester would be Saturday, the 3rd of June </s>
<s> It is possible that the depression of the times may render a performance in Manchester unwise </s>
<s> In that case I would immediately abandon the idea </s>
<s> But what I want to know, _by return of post_ is, is it safe or unsafe </s>
<s> If the former, here is the bill as it stood in London, with the addition, on the back, of a paragraph I would insert in Manchester, of which immediate use can be made </s>

<s> I found that I _did_ stand in some sort committed to Mr Evans, though not so much so but that I could with perfect ease have declined to place Charley in his house if I had desired to do so </s>
<s> I must say, however, that after seeing Mr Cookesley (a most excellent man in his way) and seeing Mr Evans, and Mr Evans's house, I think I should, under any circumstances, have given the latter the preference as to the domestic part of Charley's life </s>
<s> I would certainly prefer to try it </s>
<s> I therefore thought it best to propose to have Mr Cookesley for his tutor, and to place him as a boarder with Mr Evans </s>
<s> Both gentlemen seemed satisfied with this arrangement, and Dr </s>
<s> Hawtrey expressed his approval of it also </s>
<s> Mr Cookesley, wishing to know what Charley could do, asked me if I would object to leaving him there for half-an-hour or so </s>
<s> As Charley appeared not at all afraid of this proposal, I left him then and there </s>
<s> On my return, Mr Cookesley said, in high and unqualified terms, that he had been thoroughly well grounded and well taught--that he had examined him in Virgil and Herodotus, and that he not only knew what he was about perfectly well, but showed an intelligence in reference to those authors which did his tutor great credit </s>
<s> He really appeared most interested and pleased, and filled me with a grateful feeling towards you, to whom Charley owes so much </s>
<s> He said there were certain verses in imitation of Horace (I really forget what sort of verses) to which Charley was unaccustomed, and which were a little matter enough in themselves, but were made a great point of at Eton, and could be got up well in a month "_from an Old Etonian_" </s>
<s> For this purpose he would desire Charley to be sent every day to a certain Mr Hardisty, in Store Street, Bedford Square, to whom he had already (in my absence) prepared a note </s>
<s> Between ourselves, I must not hesitate to tell you plainly that this appeared to me to be a conventional way of bestowing a little patronage </s>
<s> But, of course, I had nothing for it but to say it should be done; upon which, Mr Cookesley added that he was then certain that Charley, on coming after the Christmas holidays, would be placed at once in "the remove," which seemed to surprise Mr Evans when I afterwards told him of it as a high station </s>
<s> I will take him to this gentleman on Monday, and arrange for his going there every day; but, if you will not object, I should still like him to remain with you, and to have the advantage of preparing these annoying verses under your eye until the holidays </s>
<s> That Mr Cookesley may have his own way thoroughly, I will send Charley to Mr Hardisty daily until the school at Eton recommences </s>
<s> Let me impress upon you in the strongest manner, not only that I was inexpressibly delighted myself by the readiness with which Charley went through this ordeal with a stranger, but that I also saw you would have been well pleased and much gratified if you could have seen Mr Cookesley afterwards </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.] BROADSTAIRS, KENT, _Tuesday, 3rd September, 1850._ MY DEAR SIR EDWARD, I have had the long-contemplated talk with Forster about the play, and write to assure you that I shall be delighted to come down to Knebworth and do Bobadil, or anything else, provided it would suit your convenience to hold the great dramatic festival in the last week of October </s>
<s> The concluding number of "Copperfield" will prevent me from leaving here until Saturday, the 26th of that month </s>
<s> If I were at my own disposal, I hope I need not say I should be at yours </s>
<s> Forster will tell you with what men we must do the play, and what laurels we would propose to leave for the gathering of new aspirants; of whom I hope you have a reasonable stock in your part of the country </s>
<s> Do you know Mary Boyle--daughter of the old Admiral </s>
<s> because she is the very best actress I ever saw off the stage, and immeasurably better than a great many I have seen on it </s>
<s> I have acted with her in a country house in Northamptonshire, and am going to do so again next November </s>
<s> If you know her, I think she would be more than pleased to play, and by giving her something good in a farce we could get her to do Mrs Kitely </s>
<s> In that case my little sister-in-law would "go on" for the second lady, and you could do without actresses, besides giving the thing a particular grace and interest </s>
<s> If we could get Mary Boyle, we would do "Used Up," which is a delightful piece, as the farce </s>
<s> But maybe you know nothing about the said Mary, and in that case I should like to know what you would think of doing </s>
<s> You gratify me more than I can tell you by what you say about "Copperfield," the more so as I hope myself that some heretofore-deficient qualities are there </s>
<s> You are not likely to misunderstand me when I say that I like it very much, and am deeply interested in it, and that I have kept and am keeping my mind very steadily upon it </s>
<s> Believe me always, very faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Sunday Night, November 3rd, 1850._ MY DEAR BULWER LYTTON, I should have waited at home to-day on the chance of your calling, but that I went over to look after Lemon; and I went for this reason: the surgeon opines that there is no possibility of Mrs Dickens being able to play, although she is going on "as well as possible," which I sincerely believe </s>
<s> Now, _when_ the accident happened, Mrs Lemon told my little sister-in-law that she would gladly undertake the part if it should become necessary </s>
<s> Going after her to-day, I found that she and Lemon had gone out of town, but will be back to-night </s>
<s> I have written to her, earnestly urging her to the redemption of her offer </s>
<s> I have no doubt of being able to see her well up in the characters; and I hope you approve of this remedy </s>
<s> If she once screws her courage to the sticking place, I have no fear of her whatever </s>
<s> This is what I would say to you </s>
<s> If I don't see you here, I will write to you at Forster's, reporting progress </s>
<s> Don't be discouraged, for I am full of confidence, and resolve to do the utmost that is in me--and I well know they all will--to make the nights at Knebworth _triumphant_ </s>
<s> Once in a thing like this--once in everything, to my thinking--it must be carried out like a mighty enterprise, heart and soul </s>
<s> Pray regard me as wholly at the disposal of the theatricals, until they shall be gloriously achieved </s>
<s> My unfortunate other half (lying in bed) is very anxious that I should let you know that she means to break her heart if she should be prevented from coming as one of the audience, and that she has been devising means all day of being brought down in the brougham with her foot upon a T </s>
<s> Ever faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] OFFICE OF "HOUSEHOLD WORDS," _Wednesday Evening, November 13th, 1850._ MY DEAR BULWER LYTTON, On the principle of postponing nothing connected with the great scheme, I have been to Ollivier's, where I found our friend the choremusicon in a very shattered state--his mouth wide open--the greater part of his teeth out--his bowels disclosed to the public eye--and his whole system frightfully disordered </s>
<s> In this condition he is speechless </s>
<s> I cannot, therefore, report touching his eloquence, but I find he is a piano as well as a choremusicon--that he requires to pass through no intermediate stage between choremusicon and piano, and therefore that he can easily and certainly accompany songs </s>
<s> Now, will you have it </s>
<s> I am inclined to believe that on the whole, it is the best thing </s>
<s> I have not heard of anything else having happened to anybody </s>
<s> If I should not find you gone to Australia or elsewhere, and should not have occasion to advertise in the third column of _The Times_, I shall hope not to add to your misfortunes--I dare not say to afford you consolation--by shaking hands with you to-morrow night, and afterwards keeping every man connected with the theatrical department to his duty </s>
<s> Ever faithfully yours </s>
<s> 1851 </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Sunday Night, January 5th, 1851._ MY DEAR BULWER, I am so sorry to have missed you </s>
<s> I had gone down to Forster, comedy in hand </s>
<s> I think it _most admirable_.[44] Full of character, strong in interest, rich in capital situations, and _certain to go nobly_ </s>
<s> You know how highly I thought of "Money," but I sincerely think these three acts finer </s>
<s> I did not think of the slight suggestions you make, but I said, _en passant_, that perhaps the drunken scene might do better on the stage a little concentrated </s>
<s> I don't believe it would require even that, with the leading-up which you propose </s>
<s> I cannot say too much of the comedy to express what I think and feel concerning it; and I look at it, too, remember, with the yellow eye of an actor </s>
<s> I should have taken to it (need I say so!) _con amore_ in any case, but I should have been jealous of your reputation, exactly as I appreciate your generosity </s>
<s> If I had a misgiving of ten lines I should have scrupulously mentioned it </s>
<s> Stone will take the Duke capitally; and I will answer for his being got into doing it _very well_ </s>
<s> Looking down the perspective of a few winter evenings here, I am confident about him </s>
<s> Forster will be thoroughly sound and real </s>
<s> Lemon is so surprisingly sensible and trustworthy on the stage, that I don't think any actor could touch his part as he will; and I hope you will have opportunities of testing the accuracy of this prediction </s>
<s> Egg ought to do the Author to absolute perfection </s>
<s> As to Jerrold--there he stands in the play </s>
<s> I would propose Leech (well made up) for Easy </s>
<s> He is a good name, and I see nothing else for him </s>
<s> This brings me to my own part </s>
<s> If we had anyone, or could get anyone, for Wilmot, I could do (I think) something so near your meaning in Sir Gilbert, that I let him go with a pang </s>
<s> Assumption has charms for me--I hardly know for how many wild reasons--so delightful, that I feel a loss of, oh </s>
<s> I can't say what exquisite foolery, when I lose a chance of being someone in voice, etc, not at all like myself </s>
<s> But--I speak quite freely, knowing you will not mistake me--I know from experience that we could find nobody to hold the play together in Wilmot if I didn't do it </s>
<s> I think I could touch the gallant, generous, careless pretence, with the real man at the bottom of it, so as to take the audience with him from the first scene </s>
<s> I am quite sure I understand your meaning; and I am absolutely certain that as Jerrold, Forster, and Stone came in, I could, as a mere little bit of mechanics, present them better by doing that part, and paying as much attention to their points as my own, than another amateur actor could </s>
<s> Therefore I throw up my cap for Wilmot, and hereby devote myself to him, heart and head </s>
<s> I ought to tell you that in a play we once rehearsed and never played (but rehearsed several times, and very carefully), I saw Lemon do a piece of reality with a rugged pathos in it, which I felt, as I stood on the stage with him to be extraordinarily good </s>
<s> In the serious part of Sir Gilbert he will surprise you </s>
<s> And he has an intuitive discrimination in such things which will just keep the suspicious part from being too droll at the outset--which will just show a glimpse of something in the depths of it </s>
<s> The moment I come back to town (within a fortnight, please God!) I will ascertain from Forster where you are </s>
<s> Then I will propose to you that we call our company together, agree upon one general plan of action, and that you and I immediately begin to see and book our Vice-Presidents, etc Further, I think we ought to see about the Queen </s>
<s> I would suggest our playing first about three weeks before the opening of the Exhibition, in order that it may be the town talk before the country people and foreigners come </s>
<s> Macready thinks with me that a very large sum of money may be got in London </s>
<s> I propose (for cheapness and many other considerations) to make a theatre expressly for the purpose, which we can put up and take down--say in the Hanover Square Rooms--and move into the country </s>
<s> As Watson wanted something of a theatre made for his forthcoming Little Go, I have made it a sort of model of what I mean, and shall be able to test its working powers before I see you </s>
<s> Many things that, for portability, were to be avoided in Mr Hewitt's theatre, I have replaced with less expensive and weighty contrivances </s>
<s> Now, my dear Bulwer, I have come to the small hours, and am writing alone here, as if _I_ were writing something to do what your comedy will </s>
<s> At such a time the temptation is strong upon me to say a great deal more, but I will only say this--in mercy to you--that I do devoutly believe that this plan carried, will entirely change the status of the literary man in England, and make a revolution in his position, which no Government, no power on earth but his own, could ever effect </s>
<s> I have implicit confidence in the scheme--so splendidly begun--if we carry it out with a steadfast energy </s>
<s> I have a strong conviction that we hold in our hands the peace and honour of men of letters for centuries to come, and that you are destined to be their best and most enduring benefactor </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> what a procession of New Years might walk out of all this, after we are very dusty </s>
<s> Ever yours faithfully </s>
<s> P.S.--I have forgotten something </s>
<s> I suggest this title: "Knowing the World; or, Not So Bad As We Seem" </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Tuesday Night, March 4th, 1851._ MY DEAR BULWER, I know you will be glad to hear what I have to tell you </s>
<s> I wrote to the Duke of Devonshire this morning, enclosing him the rough proof of the scheme, and plainly telling him what we wanted, _i.e._, to play for the first time at his house, to the Queen and Court </s>
<s> Within a couple of hours he wrote me as follows: "DEAR SIR, "I have read with very great interest the prospectus of the new endowment which you have confided to my perusal </s>
<s> "Your manner of doing so is a proof that I am honoured by your goodwill and approbation </s>
<s> "I'm truly happy to offer you my earnest and sincere co-operation </s>
<s> My services, my house, and my subscription will be at your orders </s>
<s> And I beg you to let me see you before long, not merely to converse upon this subject, but because I have long had the greatest wish to improve our acquaintance, which has, as yet, been only one of crowded rooms" </s>
<s> This is quite princely, I think, and will push us along as brilliantly as heart could desire </s>
<s> Don't you think so too </s>
<s> Yesterday Lemon and I saw the Secretary of the National Provident Institution (the best Office for the purpose, I am inclined to think) and stated all our requirements </s>
<s> We appointed to meet the chairman and directors next Tuesday; so on the day of our reading and dining I hope we shall have that matter in good time </s>
<s> The theatre is also under consultation; and directly after the reading we shall go briskly to work in all departments </s>
<s> I hear nothing but praises of your Macready speech--of its eloquence, delicacy, and perfect taste, all of which it is good to hear, though I know it all beforehand as well as most men can tell it me </s>
<s> Ever cordially </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Tuesday Morning, 25th March, 1851._ MY DEAR BULWER, Coming home at midnight last night after our first rehearsal, I find your letter </s>
<s> I write to entreat you, if you make any change in the first three acts, to let it be only of the slightest kind </s>
<s> Because we are now fairly under way, everybody is already drilled into his place, and in two or three rehearsals those acts will be in a tolerably presentable state </s>
<s> It is of vital importance that we should get the last two acts _soon_ </s>
<s> The Queen and Prince are coming--Phipps wrote me yesterday the most earnest letter possible--the time is fearfully short, and we _must_ have the comedy in such a state as that it will go like a machine </s>
<s> Whatever you do, for heaven's sake don't be persuaded to endanger that </s>
<s> Even at the risk of your falling into the pit with despair at beholding anything of the comedy in its present state, if you can by any possibility come down to Covent Garden Theatre to-night, do </s>
<s> I hope you will see in Lemon the germ of a very fine presentation of Sir Geoffrey </s>
<s> I think Topham, too, will do Easy admirably </s>
<s> We really did wonders last night in the way of arrangement </s>
<s> I see the ground-plan of the first three acts distinctly </s>
<s> The dressing and furnishing and so forth, will be a perfect picture, and I will answer for the men in three weeks' time </s>
<s> In great haste, my dear Bulwer, Ever faithfully yours </s>

<s> COWDEN CLARKE, Ah, those were days indeed, when we were so fatigued at dinner that we couldn't speak, and so revived at supper that we couldn't go to bed; when wild in inns the noble savage ran; and all the world was a stage, gas-lighted in a double sense--by the Young Gas and the old one </s>
<s> When Emmeline Montague (now Compton, and the mother of two children) came to rehearse in our new comedy[45] the other night, I nearly fainted </s>
<s> The gush of recollection was so overpowering that I couldn't bear it </s>
<s> I use the portfolio[46] for managerial papers still </s>
<s> That's something </s>
<s> But all this does not thank you for your book.[47] I have not got it yet (being here with Mrs Dickens, who has been very unwell), but I shall be in town early in the week, and shall bring it down to read quietly on these hills, where the wind blows as freshly as if there were no Popes and no Cardinals whatsoever--nothing the matter anywhere </s>
<s> I thank you a thousand times, beforehand, for the pleasure you are going to give me </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Mr Mitton.] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _19th April, 1851._ MY DEAR MITTON, I have been in trouble, or I should have written to you sooner </s>
<s> My wife has been, and is, far from well </s>
<s> My poor father's death caused me much distress </s>
<s> I came to London last Monday to preside at a public dinner--played with little Dora, my youngest child, before I went--and was told when I left the chair that she had died in a moment </s>
<s> I am quite happy again, but I have undergone a good deal </s>
<s> I am not going back to Malvern, but have let this house until September, and taken the "Fort," at Broadstairs </s>
<s> Faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.] DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Monday, 28th April, 1851._ MY DEAR BULWER, I see you are so anxious, that I shall endeavour to send you this letter by a special messenger </s>
<s> I think I can relieve your mind completely </s>
<s> The Duke has read the play </s>
<s> He asked for it a week ago, and had it </s>
<s> He has been at Brighton since </s>
<s> He called here before eleven on Saturday morning, but I was out on the play business, so I went to him at Devonshire House yesterday </s>
<s> He almost knows the play by heart </s>
<s> He is supremely delighted with it, and critically understands it </s>
<s> In proof of the latter part of this sentence I may mention that he had made two or three memoranda of trivial doubtful points, _every one of which had attracted our attention in rehearsal_, as I found when he showed them to me </s>
<s> He thoroughly understands and appreciates the comedy of the Duke--threw himself back in his chair and laughed, as I say of Walpole, "till I thought he'd have choked," about his first Duchess, who was a Percy </s>
<s> He suggested that he shouldn't say: "You know how to speak to the heart of a Noble," because it was not likely that he would call himself a Noble </s>
<s> He thought we might close up the Porter and Softhead a little more (already done) and was so charmed and delighted to recall the comedy that he was more pleased than any boy you ever saw when I repeated two or three of the speeches in my part for him </s>
<s> He is coming to the rehearsal to-day (we rehearse now at Devonshire House, three days a-week, all day long), and, since he read the play, has conceived a most magnificent and noble improvement in the Devonshire House plan, by which, I daresay, we shall get another thousand or fifteen hundred pounds </s>
<s> There is not a grain of distrust or doubt in him </s>
<s> I am perfectly certain that he would confide to me, and does confide to me, his whole mind on the subject </s>
<s> More than this, the Duke comes out the best man in the play </s>
<s> I am happy to report to you that Stone does the honourable manly side of that pride inexpressibly better than I should have supposed possible in him </s>
<s> The scene where he makes that reparation to the slandered woman is _certain_ to be an effect </s>
<s> He is _not_ a jest upon the order of Dukes, but a great tribute to them </s>
<s> I have sat looking at the play (as you may suppose) pretty often, and carefully weighing every syllable of it </s>
<s> I see, in the Duke, the most estimable character in the piece </s>
<s> I am as sure that I represent the audience in this as I am that I hear the words when they are spoken before me </s>
<s> The first time that scene with Hardman was seriously done, it made an effect on the company that quite surprised and delighted me; and whenever and wherever it is done (but most of all at Devonshire House) the result will be the same </s>
<s> Everyone is greatly improved </s>
<s> I wrote an earnest note to Forster a few days ago on the subject of his being too loud and violent </s>
<s> He has since subdued himself with the most admirable pains, and improved the part a thousand per cent </s>
<s> All the points are gradually being worked and smoothed out with the utmost neatness all through the play </s>
<s> They are all most heartily anxious and earnest, and, upon the least hitch, will do the same thing twenty times over </s>
<s> The scenery, furniture, etc, are rapidly advancing towards completion, and will be beautiful </s>
<s> The dresses are a perfect blaze of colour, and there is not a pocket-flap or a scrap of lace that has not been made according to Egg's drawings to the quarter of an inch </s>
<s> Every wig has been made from an old print or picture </s>
<s> From the Duke's snuff-box to Will's Coffee-house, you will find everything in perfect truth and keeping </s>
<s> I have resolved that whenever we come to a weak place in the acting, it must, somehow or other, be made a strong one </s>
<s> The places that I used to be most afraid of are among the best points now </s>
<s> Will you come to the dress rehearsal on the Tuesday evening before the Queen's night </s>
<s> There will be no one present but the Duke </s>
<s> I write in the greatest haste, for the rehearsal time is close at hand, and I have the master carpenter and gasman to see before we begin </s>
<s> Miss Coutts is one of the most sensible of women, and if I had not seen the Duke yesterday, I would have shown her the play directly </s>
<s> But there can't be any room for anxiety on the head that has troubled you so much </s>
<s> You may clear it from your mind as completely as Gunpowder Plot </s>

<s> _8th September, 1851._ You never saw such a sight as the sands between this and Margate presented yesterday </s>
<s> This day fortnight a steamer laden with cattle going from Rotterdam to the London market, was wrecked on the Goodwin--on which occasion, by-the-bye, the coming in at night of our Salvage Luggers laden with dead cattle, which where hoisted up upon the pier where they lay in heaps, was a most picturesque and striking sight </s>
<s> The sea since Wednesday has been very rough, blowing in straight upon the land </s>
<s> Yesterday, the shore was strewn with hundreds of oxen, sheep, and pigs (and with bushels upon bushels of apples), in every state and stage of decay--burst open, rent asunder, lying with their stiff hoofs in the air, or with their great ribs yawning like the wrecks of ships--tumbled and beaten out of shape, and yet with a horrible sort of humanity about them </s>
<s> Hovering among these carcases was every kind of water-side plunderer, pulling the horns out, getting the hides off, chopping the hoofs with poleaxes, etc etc, attended by no end of donkey carts, and spectral horses with scraggy necks, galloping wildly up and down as if there were something maddening in the stench </s>

<s> Allowing for the necessarily heavy expenses of all kinds, I believe we can hardly fund less than a Thousand Pounds out of this trip alone </s>
<s> And, more than that, the extraordinary interest taken in the idea of the Guild by "this grand people of England" down in these vast hives, and the enthusiastic welcome they give it, assure me that we may do what we will if we will only be true and faithful to our design </s>
<s> There is a social recognition of it which I cannot give you the least idea of </s>
<s> I sincerely believe that we have the ball at our feet, and may throw it up to the very Heaven of Heavens </s>
<s> And I don't speak for myself alone, but for all our people, and not least of all for Forster, who has been absolutely stunned by the tremendous earnestness of these great places </s>
<s> To tell you (especially after your affectionate letter) what I would have given to have had you there would be idle </s>
<s> But I can most seriously say that all the sights of the earth turned pale in my eyes, before the sight of three thousand people with one heart among them, and no capacity in them, in spite of all their efforts, of sufficiently testifying to you how they believe you to be right, and feel that they cannot do enough to cheer you on </s>
<s> They understood the play (_far better acted by this time than ever you have seen it_) as well as you do </s>
<s> They allowed nothing to escape them </s>
<s> They rose up, when it was over, with a perfect fury of delight, and the Manchester people sent a requisition after us to Liverpool to say that if we will go back there in May, when we act at Birmingham (as of course we shall) they will joyfully undertake to fill the Free Trade Hall again </s>
<s> Among the Tories of Liverpool the reception was equally enthusiastic </s>
<s> We played, two nights running, to a hall crowded to the roof--more like the opera at Genoa or Milan than anything else I can compare it to </s>

<s> Next morning early we mean to try the Simplon </s>
<s> After breakfast to-day we ascended to the Mer de Glace--wonderfully different at this time of the year from when we saw it--a great portion of the ascent being covered with snow, and the climbing very difficult </s>
<s> Regardless of my mule, I walked up and walked down again, to the great admiration of the guides, who pronounced me "an Intrepid" </s>
<s> The little house at the top being closed for the winter, and Edward having forgotten to carry any brandy, we had nothing to drink at the top--which was a considerable disappointment to the Inimitable, who was streaming with perspiration from head to foot </s>
<s> But we made a fire in the snow with some sticks, and after a not too comfortable rest came down again </s>
<s> It took a long time--from 10 to 3 </s>
<s> The appearance of Chamounix at this time of year is very remarkable </s>
<s> The travellers are over for the season, the inns are generally shut up, all the people who can afford it are moving off to Geneva, the snow is low on the mountains, and the general desolation and grandeur extraordinarily fine </s>
<s> I wanted to pass by the Col de Balme, but the snow lies too deep upon it </s>
<s> You would have been quite delighted if you could have seen the warmth of our old Lausanne friends, and the heartiness with which they crowded down on a fearfully bad morning to see us off </s>

<s> I shall leave this open, as usual, to add a word or two on our arrival at Martigny </s>
<s> We have had an amusingly absurd incident this afternoon </s>
<s> When we came here, I saw added to the hotel--our old hotel, and I am now writing in the room where we once dined at the table d'hôte--some baths, cold and hot, down on the margin of the torrent below </s>
<s> This induced us to order three hot baths </s>
<s> Thereupon the keys of the bath-rooms were found with immense difficulty, women ran backwards and forwards across the bridge, men bore in great quantities of wood, a horrible furnace was lighted, and a smoke was raised which filled the whole valley </s>
<s> This began at half-past three, and we congratulated each other on the distinction we should probably acquire by being the cause of the conflagration of the whole village </s>
<s> We sat by the fire until half-past five (dinner-time), and still no baths </s>
<s> Then Edward came up to say that the water was as yet only "tippit," which we suppose to be tepid, but that by half-past eight it would be in a noble state </s>
<s> Ever since the smoke has poured forth in enormous volume, and the furnace has blazed, and the women have gone and come over the bridge, and piles of wood have been carried in; but we observe a general avoidance of us by the establishment which still looks like failure </s>
<s> We have had a capital dinner, the dessert whereof is now on the table </s>
<s> When we arrived, at nearly seven last night, all the linen in the house, newly washed, was piled in the sitting-room, all the curtains were taken down, and all the chairs piled bottom upwards </s>
<s> They cleared away as much as they could directly, and had even got the curtains up at breakfast this morning </s>
<s> I am looking forward to letters at Genoa, though I doubt if we shall get there (supposing all things right at the Simplon) before Monday night or Tuesday morning </s>

<s> We crossed the Simplon on Sunday, when there was not (as there is not now) a particle of cloud in the whole sky, and when the pass was as nobly grand and beautiful as it possibly can be </s>
<s> There was a good deal of snow upon the top, but not across the road, which had been cleared </s>
<s> We crossed the Austrian frontier yesterday, and, both there and at the gate of Milan, received all possible consideration and politeness </s>
<s> I have not seen Bairr yet </s>
<s> He has removed from the old hotel to a larger one at a few hours' distance </s>
<s> The head-waiter remembered me very well last night after I had talked to him a little while, and was greatly interested in hearing about all the family, and about poor Roche </s>
<s> The boy we used to have at Lausanne is now seventeen-and-a-half--very tall, he says </s>
<s> The elder girl, fifteen, very like her mother, but taller and more beautiful </s>
<s> He described poor Mrs Bairr's death (I am speaking of the head-waiter before mentioned) in most vivacious Italian </s>
<s> It was all over in ten minutes, he said </s>
<s> She put her hands to her head one day, down in the courtyard, and cried out that she heard little bells ringing violently in her ears </s>
<s> They sent off for Bairr, who was close by </s>
<s> When she saw him, she stretched out her arms, said in English, "Adieu, my dear" </s>
<s> and fell dead </s>
<s> He has not married again, and he never will </s>
<s> She was a good woman (my friend went on), excellent woman, full of charity, loved the poor, but _un poco furiosa_--that was nothing </s>
<s> The new hotel is just like the old one, admirably kept, excellently furnished, and a model of comfort </s>
<s> I hope to be at Genoa on Thursday morning, and to find your letter there </s>
<s> We have agreed to drop Sicily, and to return home by way of Marseilles </s>
<s> Our projected time for reaching London is the 10th of December </s>
<s> As this house is full, I daresay we shall meet some one we know at the table d'hôte to-day </s>
<s> It is extraordinary that the only travellers we have encountered, since we left Paris, have been one horribly vapid Englishman and wife whom we dropped at Basle, one boring Englishman whom we found (and, thank God, left) at Geneva, and two English maiden ladies, whom we found sitting on a rock (with parasols) the day before yesterday, in the most magnificent part of the Gorge of Gondo, the most awful portion of the Simplon--there awaiting their travelling chariot, in which, with their money, their parasols, and a perfect shop of baskets, they were carefully _locked up_ by an English servant in sky blue and silver buttons </s>
<s> We have been in the most extraordinary vehicles--like swings, like boats, like Noah's arks, like barges and enormous bedsteads </s>
<s> After dark last night, a landlord, where we changed horses, discovered that the luggage would certainly be stolen from _questo porco d'uno carro_--this pig of a cart--his complimentary description of our carriage, unless cords were attached to each of the trunks, which cords were to hang down so that we might hold them in our hands all the way, and feel any tug that might be made at our treasures </s>
<s> You will imagine the absurdity of our jolting along some twenty miles in this way, exactly as if we were in three shower-baths and were afraid to pull the string </s>
<s> We are going to the Scala to-night, having got the old box belonging to the hotel, the old key of which is lying beside me on the table </s>
<s> There seem to be no singers of note here now, and it appears for the time to have fallen off considerably </s>
<s> I shall now bring this to a close, hoping that I may have more interesting jottings to send you about the old scenes and people, from Genoa, where we shall stay two days </s>
<s> You are now, I take it, at Macready's </s>
<s> I shall be greatly interested by your account of your visit there </s>
<s> We often talk of you all </s>
<s> Edward's Italian is (I fear) very weak </s>

<s> But he seems to have picked up a little this morning </s>

<s> I write this before going to bed, that I may be sure of not being taken by any engagement off the post time to-morrow </s>
<s> We came in last night between seven and eight </s>
<s> The railroad to Turin is finished and opened to within twenty miles of Genoa </s>
<s> Its effect upon the whole town, and especially upon that part of it lying down beyond the lighthouse and away by San Pietro d'Arena, is quite wonderful </s>
<s> I only knew the place by the lighthouse, so numerous were the new buildings, so wide the streets, so busy the people, and so thriving and busy the many signs of commerce </s>
<s> To-day I have seen ----, the ----, the ----, and the ----, the latter of whom live at Nervi, fourteen or fifteen miles off, towards Porto Fino </s>
<s> First, of the ---- </s>
<s> They are just the same, except that Mrs ----'s face is larger and fuller, and her hair rather gray </s>
<s> As I rang at their bell she came out walking, and stared at me </s>
<s> "What </s>
<s> you don't know me" </s>
<s> said I; upon which she recognised me very warmly, and then said in her old quiet way: "I expected to find a ruin </s>
<s> We heard you had been so ill; and I find you younger and better-looking than ever </s>
<s> But it's so strange to see you without a bright waistcoat </s>
<s> Why haven't you got a bright waistcoat on" </s>
<s> I apologised for my black one, and was sent upstairs, when ---- presently appeared in a hideous and demoniacal nightdress, having turned out of bed to greet his distinguished countryman </s>
<s> After a long talk, in the course of which I arranged to dine there on Sunday early, before starting by the steamer for Naples, and in which they told me every possible and impossible particular about their minutest affairs, and especially about ----'s marriage, I set off for ----, at ---- </s>
<s> I had found letters from him here, and he had been here over and over again, and had driven out no end of times to the Gate to leave messages for me, and really is (in his strange uncouth way) crying glad to see me </s>
<s> I found him and his wife in a little comfortable country house, overlooking the sea, sitting in a small summer-house on wheels, exactly like a bathing machine </s>
<s> I found her rather pretty, extraordinarily cold and composed, a mere piece of furniture, _talking broken English_ </s>
<s> Through eight months in the year they live in this country place </s>
<s> She never reads, never works, never talks, never gives an order or directs anything, has only a taste for going to the theatre (where she never speaks either) and buying clothes </s>
<s> They sit in the garden all day, dine at four, _smoke their cigars_, go in at eight, sit about till ten, and then go to bed </s>
<s> The greater part of this I had from ---- himself in a particularly unintelligible confidence in the garden, the only portion of which that I could clearly understand were the words "and one thing and another," repeated one hundred thousand times </s>
<s> He described himself as being perfectly happy, and seemed very fond of his wife </s>
<s> "But that," said ---- to me this morning, looking like the figure-head of a ship, with a nutmeg-grater for a face, "that he ought to be, and must be, and is bound to be--he couldn't help it" </s>
<s> Then I went on to the ----'s, and found them living in a beautiful situation in a ruinous Albaro-like palace </s>
<s> Coming upon them unawares, I found ----, with a pointed beard, smoking a great German pipe, in a pair of slippers; the two little girls very pale and faint from the climate, in a singularly untidy state--one (heaven knows why!) without stockings, and both with their little short hair cropped in a manner never before beheld, and a little bright bow stuck on the top of it </s>
<s> ---- said she had invented this headgear as a picturesque thing, adding that perhaps it was--and perhaps it was not </s>
<s> She was greatly flushed and agitated, but looked very well, and seems to be greatly liked here </s>
<s> We had disturbed her at her painting in oils, and I rather received an impression that, what with that, and what with music, the household affairs went a little to the wall </s>

<s> We have a charming apartment opposite the sea, a little lower down than the Victoria--in the direction of the San Carlo Theatre--and the windows are now wide open as on an English summer night </s>
<s> The first persons we found on board at Genoa, were Emerson Tennent, Lady Tennent, their son and daughter </s>
<s> They are all here too, in an apartment over ours, and we have all been constantly together in a very friendly way, ever since our meeting </s>
<s> We dine at the table d'hôte--made a league together on board--and have been mutually agreeable </s>
<s> They have no servant with them, and have profited by Edward </s>
<s> He goes on perfectly well, is always cheerful and ready, has been sleeping on board (upside down, I believe), in a corner, with his head in the wet and his heels against the side of the paddle-box--but has been perpetually gay and fresh </s>
<s> As soon as we got our luggage from the custom house, we packed complete changes in a bag, set off in a carriage for some warm baths, and had a most refreshing cleansing after our long journey </s>
<s> There was an odd Neapolitan attendant--a steady old man--who, bringing the linen into my bath, proposed to "soap me" </s>
<s> Upon which I called out to the other two that I intended to have everything done to me that could be done, and gave him directions accordingly </s>
<s> I was frothed all over with Naples soap, rubbed all down, scrubbed with a brush, had my nails cut, and all manner of extraordinary operations performed </s>
<s> He was as much disappointed (apparently) as surprised not to find me dirty, and kept on ejaculating under his breath, "Oh, Heaven </s>
<s> how clean this Englishman is" </s>
<s> He also remarked that the Englishman is as fair as a beautiful woman </s>
<s> Some relations of Lord John Russell's, going to Malta, were aboardship, and we were very pleasant </s>
<s> Likewise there was a Mr Young aboard--an agreeable fellow, not very unlike Forster in person--who introduced himself as the brother of the Miss Youngs whom we knew at Boulogne </s>
<s> He was musical and had much good-fellowship in him, and we were very agreeable together also </s>

<s> You would have been quite touched if you could have seen the honest warmth of his affection </s>
<s> On the occasion of this second banquet, Egg made a brilliant mistake that perfectly convulsed us all </s>
<s> I had introduced all the games with great success, and we were playing at the "What advice would you have given that person" </s>
<s> game </s>
<s> The advice was "Not to bully his fellow-creatures" </s>
<s> Upon which, Egg triumphantly and with the greatest glee, screamed, "Mr ----" </s>
<s> utterly forgetting ----'s relationship, which I had elaborately impressed upon him </s>
<s> The effect was perfectly irresistible and uncontrollable; and the little woman's way of humouring the joke was in the best taste and the best sense </s>
<s> While I am upon Genoa I may add, that when we left the Croce the landlord, in hoping that I was satisfied, told me that as I was an old inhabitant, he had charged the prices "as to a Genoese" </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Miss King.] TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Friday Evening, February 9th, 1855._ MY DEAR MISS KING, I wish to get over the disagreeable part of my letter in the beginning </s>
<s> I have great doubts of the possibility of publishing your story in portions </s>
<s> But I think it possesses _very great merit_ </s>
<s> My doubts arise partly from the nature of the interest which I fear requires presentation as a whole, and partly on your manner of relating the tale </s>
<s> The people do not sufficiently work out their own purposes in dialogue and dramatic action </s>
<s> You are too much their exponent; what you do for them, they ought to do for themselves </s>
<s> With reference to publication in detached portions (or, indeed, with a reference to the force of the story in any form), that long stoppage and going back to possess the reader with the antecedents of the clergyman's biography, are rather crippling </s>
<s> I may mention that I think the boy (the child of the second marriage) a little too "slangy" </s>
<s> I know the kind of boyish slang which belongs to such a character in these times; but, considering his part in the story, I regard it as the author's function to elevate such a characteristic, and soften it into something more expressive of the ardour and flush of youth, and its romance </s>
<s> It seems to me, too, that the dialogues between the lady and the Italian maid are conventional but not natural </s>
<s> This observation I regard as particularly applying to the maid, and to the scene preceding the murder </s>
<s> Supposing the main objection surmountable, I would venture then to suggest to you the means of improvement in this respect </s>
<s> The paper is so full of good touches of character, passion, and natural emotion, that I very much wish for a little time to reconsider it, and to try whether condensation here and there would enable us to get it say into four parts </s>
<s> I am not sanguine of this, for I observed the difficulties as I read it the night before last; but I am very unwilling, I assure you, to decline what has so much merit </s>
<s> I am going to Paris on Sunday morning for ten days or so </s>
<s> I purpose being back again within a fortnight </s>
<s> If you will let me think of this matter in the meanwhile, I shall at least have done all I can to satisfy my own appreciation of your work </s>
<s> But if, in the meantime, you should desire to have it back with any prospect of publishing it through other means, a letter--the shortest in the world--from you to Mr Wills at the "Household Words" office will immediately produce it </s>
<s> I repeat with perfect sincerity that I am much impressed by its merits, and that if I had read it as the production of an entire stranger, I think it would have made exactly this effect upon me </s>
<s> My dear Miss King, Very faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _24th February, 1855._ MY DEAR MISS KING, I have gone carefully over your story again, and quite agree with you that the episode of the clergyman could be told in a very few lines </s>
<s> Startling as I know it will appear to you, I am bound to say that I think the purpose of the whole tale would be immensely strengthened by great compression </s>
<s> I doubt if it could not be told more forcibly in half the space </s>
<s> It is certainly too long for "Household Words," and I fear my idea of it is too short for you </s>
<s> I am, if possible, more unwilling than I was at first to decline it; but the more I have considered it, the longer it has seemed to grow </s>
<s> Nor can I ask you to try to present it free from that objection, because I already perceive the difficulty, and pain, of such an effort </s>
<s> To the best of my knowledge, you are wrong about the Lady at last, and to the best of my observation, you do not express what you explain yourself to mean in the case of the Italian attendant </s>
<s> I have met with such talk in the romances of Maturin's time--certainly never in Italian life </s>
<s> These, however, are slight points easily to be compromised in an hour </s>

<s> He had never spoken to ---- before, he said, and found him a rather muddle-headed Scotchman as to his powers of conveying his ideas </s>
<s> He (Higgins) had gone over his documents judicially, and with the greatest attention; and not only was ---- wrong in every particular (except one very unimportant circumstance), but, in reading documents to the House, had stopped short in sentences where no stop was, and by so doing had utterly perverted their meaning </s>
<s> This is to come out, of course, when said ---- gets the matter on </s>
<s> I thought the case so changed, before I knew this, by his letter and that of the other shipowners, that I told Morley, when I went down to the theatre, that I felt myself called upon to relieve him from the condition I had imposed </s>
<s> For the rest, I am quite calmly confident that I only do justice to the strength of my opinions, and use the power which circumstances have given me, conscientiously and moderately, with a right object, and towards the prevention of nameless miseries </s>

<s> The simplest and most affecting passage in all the noble history of our Great Master, is His consideration for little children, and in reference to yours, as many millions of bereaved mothers poor and rich will do in reference to theirs until the end of time, you may take the comfort of the generous words, "And He took a child, and set it in the midst of them" </s>
<s> In a book, by one of the greatest English writers, called "A Journey from this World to the Next," a parent comes to the distant country beyond the grave, and finds the little girl he had lost so long ago, engaged in building a bower to receive him in, when his aged steps should bring him there at last </s>

<s> But it strongly occurred to me that Webster was going to decline the play, and that he really has worried himself into a fear of playing Aaron </s>
<s> Now, when I got this into my head--which was during the rehearsal--I considered two things:--firstly, how we could best put about the success of the piece more widely and extensively even than it has yet reached; and secondly, how you could be best assisted against a bad production of it hereafter, or no production of it </s>
<s> I thought I saw immediately, that the point would be to have this representation noticed in the newspapers </s>

<s> So will you soften the reader whom you now as it were harden, and so you will bring tears from many eyes, which can only have their spring in affectionately and gently touched hearts </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.] TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Wednesday, 28th January, 1857._ MY DEAR BULWER, I thought Wills had told you as to the Guild (for I begged him to) that he can do absolutely nothing until our charter is seven years old </s>
<s> It is the stringent and express prohibition of the Act of Parliament--for which things you members, thank God, are responsible and not I </s>
<s> When I observed this clause (which was just as we were going to grant a pension, if we could agree on a good subject), I caused our Counsel's opinion to be taken on it, and there is not a doubt about it </s>
<s> I immediately recommended that there should be no expenses--that the interest on the capital should be all invested as it accrued--that the chambers should be given up and the clerk discharged--and that the Guild should have the use of the "Household Words" office rent free, and the services of Wills on the same terms </s>
<s> All of which was done </s>
<s> A letter is now copying, to be sent round to all the members, explaining, with the New Year, the whole state of the thing </s>
<s> You will receive this </s>
<s> It appears to me that it looks wholesome enough </s>
<s> But if a strong idiot comes and binds your hands, or mine, or both, for seven years, what is to be done against him </s>
<s> As to greater matters than this, however--as to all matters on this teeming Earth--it appears to me that the House of Commons and Parliament altogether, is just the dreariest failure and nuisance that has bothered this much-bothered world </s>
<s> Ever yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Miss Emily Jolly.] GRAVESEND, KENT, _10th April, 1857._ DEAR MADAM, As I am away from London for a few days, your letter has been forwarded to me </s>
<s> I can honestly encourage and assure you that I believe the depression and want of confidence under which you describe yourself as labouring to have no sufficient foundation </s>
<s> First as to "Mr Arle" </s>
<s> I have constantly heard it spoken of with great approval, and I think it a book of considerable merit </s>
<s> If I were to tell you that I see no evidence of inexperience in it, that would not be true </s>
<s> I think a little more stir and action to be desired also; but I am surprised by your being despondent about it, for I assure you that I had supposed it (always remembering that it is your first novel) to have met with a very good reception </s>
<s> I can bring to my memory--here, with no means of reference at hand--only two papers of yours that have been unsuccessful at "Household Words" </s>
<s> I think the first was called "The Brook" </s>
<s> It appeared to me to break down upon a confusion that pervaded it, between a Coroner's Inquest and a Trial </s>
<s> I have a general recollection of the mingling of the two, as to facts and forms that should have been kept apart, in some inextricable manner that was beyond my powers of disentanglement </s>
<s> The second was about a wife's writing a Novel and keeping the secret from her husband until it was done </s>
<s> I did not think the incident of sufficient force to justify the length of the narrative </s>
<s> But there is nothing fatal in either of these mischances </s>
<s> Mr Wills told me when I spoke to him of the latter paper that you had it in contemplation to offer a longer story to "Household Words" </s>
<s> If you should do so, I assure you I shall be happy to read it myself, and that I shall have a sincere desire to accept it, if possible </s>
<s> I can give you no better counsel than to look into the life about you, and to strive for what is noblest and true </s>
<s> As to further encouragement, I do not, I can most strongly add, believe that you have any reason to be downhearted </s>
<s> Very faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _Saturday Morning, 30th May, 1857._ DEAR MADAM, I read your story, with all possible attention, last night </s>
<s> I cannot tell you with what reluctance I write to you respecting it, for my opinion of it is _not_ favourable, although I perceive your heart in it, and great strength </s>
<s> Pray understand that I claim no infallibility </s>
<s> I merely express my own honest opinion, formed against my earnest desire </s>
<s> I do not lay it down as law for others, though, of course, I believe that many others would come to the same conclusion </s>
<s> It appears to me that the story is one that cannot possibly be told within the compass to which you have limited yourself </s>
<s> The three principal people are, every one of them, in the wrong with the reader, and you cannot put any of them right, without making the story extend over a longer space of time, and without anatomising the souls of the actors more slowly and carefully </s>
<s> Nothing would justify the departure of Alice, but her having some strong reason to believe that in taking that step, _she saved her lover_ </s>
<s> In your intentions as to that lover's transfer of his affections to Eleanor, I descry a striking truth; but I think it confusedly wrought out, and all but certain to fail in expressing itself </s>
<s> Eleanor, I regard as forced and overstrained </s>
<s> The natural result is, that she carries a train of anti-climax after her </s>
<s> I particularly notice this at the point when she thinks she is going to be drowned </s>
<s> The whole idea of the story is sufficiently difficult to require the most exact truth and the greatest knowledge and skill in the colouring throughout </s>
<s> In this respect I have no doubt of its being extremely defective </s>
<s> The people do not talk as such people would; and the little subtle touches of description which, by making the country house and the general scene real, would give an air of reality to the people (much to be desired) are altogether wanting </s>
<s> The more you set yourself to the illustration of your heroine's passionate nature, the more indispensable this attendant atmosphere of truth becomes </s>
<s> It would, in a manner, oblige the reader to believe in her </s>
<s> Whereas, for ever exploding like a great firework without any background, she glares and wheels and hisses, and goes out, and has lighted nothing </s>
<s> Lastly, I fear she is too convulsive from beginning to end </s>
<s> Pray reconsider, from this point of view, her brow, and her eyes, and her drawing herself up to her full height, and her being a perfumed presence, and her floating into rooms, also her asking people how they dare, and the like, on small provocation </s>
<s> When she hears her music being played, I think she is particularly objectionable </s>
<s> I have a strong belief that if you keep this story by you three or four years, you will form an opinion of it not greatly differing from mine </s>
<s> There is so much good in it, so much reflection, so much passion and earnestness, that, if my judgment be right, I feel sure you will come over to it </s>
<s> On the other hand, I do not think that its publication, as it stands, would do you service, or be agreeable to you hereafter </s>
<s> I have no means of knowing whether you are patient in the pursuit of this art; but I am inclined to think that you are not, and that you do not discipline yourself enough </s>
<s> When one is impelled to write this or that, one has still to consider: "How much of this will tell for what I mean </s>
<s> How much of it is my own wild emotion and superfluous energy--how much remains that is truly belonging to this ideal character and these ideal circumstances" </s>
<s> It is in the laborious struggle to make this distinction, and in the determination to try for it, that the road to the correction of faults lies </s>
<s> [Perhaps I may remark, in support of the sincerity with which I write this, that I am an impatient and impulsive person myself, but that it has been for many years the constant effort of my life to practise at my desk what I preach to you.] I should not have written so much, or so plainly, but for your last letter to me </s>
<s> It seems to demand that I should be strictly true with you, and I am so in this letter, without any reservation either way </s>
<s> Very faithfully yours </s>

<s> 3, 1860._ MY DEAR CHORLEY, I can most honestly assure you that I think "Roccabella" a very remarkable book indeed </s>
<s> Apart--quite apart--from my interest in you, I am certain that if I had taken it up under any ordinarily favourable circumstances as a book of which I knew nothing whatever, I should not--could not--have relinquished it until I had read it through </s>
<s> I had turned but a few pages, and come to the shadow on the bright sofa at the foot of the bed, when I knew myself to be in the hands of an artist </s>
<s> That rare and delightful recognition I never lost for a moment until I closed the second volume at the end </s>
<s> I am "a good audience" when I have reason to be, and my girls would testify to you, if there were need, that I cried over it heartily </s>
<s> Your story seems to me remarkably ingenious </s>
<s> I had not the least idea of the purport of the sealed paper until you chose to enlighten me; and then I felt it to be quite natural, quite easy, thoroughly in keeping with the character and presentation of the Liverpool man </s>
<s> The position of the Bell family in the story has a special air of nature and truth; is quite new to me, and is so dexterously and delicately done that I find the deaf daughter no less real and distinct than the clergyman's wife </s>
<s> The turn of the story round that damnable Princess I pursued with a pleasure with which I could pursue nothing but a true interest; and I declare to you that if I were put upon finding anything better than the scene of Roccabella's death, I should stare round my bookshelves very much at a loss for a long time </s>
<s> Similarly, your characters have really surprised me </s>
<s> From the lawyer to the Princess, I swear to them as true; and in your fathoming of Rosamond altogether, there is a profound wise knowledge that I admire and respect with a heartiness not easily overstated in words </s>
<s> I am not quite with you as to the Italians </s>
<s> Your knowledge of the Italian character seems to me surprisingly subtle and penetrating; but I think we owe it to those most unhappy men and their political wretchedness to ask ourselves mercifully, whether their faults are not essentially the faults of a people long oppressed and priest-ridden;--whether their tendency to slink and conspire is not a tendency that spies in every dress, from the triple crown to a lousy head, have engendered in their ancestors through generations </s>
<s> Again, like you, I shudder at the distresses that come of these unavailing risings; my blood runs hotter, as yours does, at the thought of the leaders safe, and the instruments perishing by hundreds; yet what is to be done </s>
<s> Their wrongs are so great that they _will_ rise from time to time somehow </s>
<s> It would be to doubt the eternal providence of God to doubt that they will rise successfully at last </s>
<s> Unavailing struggles against a dominant tyranny precede all successful turning against it </s>
<s> And is it not a little hard in us Englishman, whose forefathers have risen so often and striven against so much, to look on, in our own security, through microscopes, and detect the motes in the brains of men driven mad </s>
<s> Think, if you and I were Italians, and had grown from boyhood to our present time, menaced in every day through all these years by that infernal confessional, dungeons, and soldiers, could we be better than these men </s>
<s> Should we be so good </s>
<s> I should not, I am afraid, if I know myself </s>
<s> Such things would make of me a moody, bloodthirsty, implacable man, who would do anything for revenge; and if I compromised the truth--put it at the worst, habitually--where should I ever have had it before me </s>
<s> In the old Jesuits' college at Genoa, on the Chiaja at Naples, in the churches of Rome, at the University of Padua, on the Piazzo San Marco at Venice, where </s>
<s> And the government is in all these places, and in all Italian places </s>
<s> I have seen something of these men </s>
<s> I have known Mazzini and Gallenga; Manin was tutor to my daughters in Paris; I have had long talks about scores of them with poor Ary Scheffer, who was their best friend </s>
<s> I have gone back to Italy after ten years, and found the best men I had known there exiled or in jail </s>
<s> I believe they have the faults you ascribe to them (nationally, not individually), but I could not find it in my heart, remembering their miseries, to exhibit those faults without referring them back to their causes </s>
<s> You will forgive my writing this, because I write it exactly as I write my cordial little tribute to the high merits of your book </s>
<s> If it were not a living reality to me, I should care nothing about this point of disagreement; but you are far too earnest a man, and far too able a man, to be left unremonstrated with by an admiring reader </s>
<s> You cannot write so well without influencing many people </s>
<s> If you could tell me that your book had but twenty readers, I would reply, that so good a book will influence more people's opinions, through those twenty, than a worthless book would through twenty thousand; and I express this with the perfect confidence of one in whose mind the book has taken, for good and all, a separate and distinct place </s>
<s> Accept my thanks for the pleasure you have given me </s>
<s> The poor acknowledgment of testifying to that pleasure wherever I go will be my pleasure in return </s>
<s> And so, my dear Chorley, good night, and God bless you </s>
<s> Ever faithfully yours </s>

<s> In that case I should (of course) have presided, as President of the Institution, and I should have asked you to honour my Falstaff house here </s>
<s> But when they made your kind intention known to me, I had made some important business engagements at the "All the Year Round" office for that evening, which I could not possibly forego </s>

<s> Although he will sufficiently enlist your sympathy on his own behalf, I am sure that you will not be the less interested in him because I am </s>
<s> Ever faithfully yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] 3, HANOVER TERRACE, _Sunday, 12th May, 1861._ MY DEAR BULWER LYTTON, I received your revised proofs only yesterday, and I sat down to read them last night </s>
<s> And before I say anything further I may tell you that I COULD NOT lay them aside, but was obliged to go on with them in my bedroom until I got into a very ghostly state indeed </s>
<s> This morning I have taken them again and have gone through them with the utmost attention </s>
<s> Of the beauty and power of the writing I say not a word, or of its originality and boldness, or of its quite extraordinary constructive skill </s>
<s> I confine myself solely to your misgiving, and to the question whether there is any sufficient foundation for it </s>
<s> On the last head I say, without the faintest hesitation, most decidedly there is NOT sufficient foundation for it </s>
<s> I do not share it in the least </s>
<s> I believe that the readers who have here given their minds (or perhaps had any to give) to those strange psychological mysteries in ourselves, of which we are all more or less conscious, will accept your wonders as curious weapons in the armoury of fiction, and will submit themselves to the Art with which said weapons are used </s>
<s> Even to that class of intelligence the marvellous addresses itself from a very strong position; and that class of intelligence is not accustomed to find the marvellous in such very powerful hands as yours </s>
<s> On more imaginative readers the tale will fall (or I am greatly mistaken) like a spell </s>
<s> By readers who combine some imagination, some scepticism, and some knowledge and learning, I hope it will be regarded as full of strange fancy and curious study, startling reflections of their own thoughts and speculations at odd times, and wonder which a master has a right to evoke </s>
<s> In the last point lies, to my thinking, the whole case </s>
<s> If you were the Magician's servant instead of the Magician, these potent spirits would get the better of you; but you _are_ the Magician, and they don't, and you make them serve your purpose </s>
<s> Occasionally in the dialogue I see an expression here and there which might--always solely with a reference to your misgiving--be better away; and I think that the vision, to use the word for want of a better--in the museum, should be made a little less abstruse </s>
<s> I should not say that, if the sale of the journal was below the sale of _The Times_ newspaper; but as it is probably several thousands higher, I do </s>
<s> I would also suggest that after the title we put the two words--A ROMANCE </s>
<s> It is an absurdly easy device for getting over your misgiving with the blockheads, but I think it would be an effective one </s>
<s> I don't, on looking at it, like the title </s>
<s> Here are a few that have occurred to me </s>
<s> "The Steel Casket" </s>
<s> "The Lost Manuscript" </s>
<s> "Derval Court" </s>
<s> "Perpetual Youth" </s>
<s> "Maggie" </s>
<s> "Dr </s>
<s> Fenwick" </s>
<s> "Life and Death" </s>
<s> The four last I think the best </s>
<s> There is an objection to "Dr </s>
<s> Fenwick" because there has been "Dr </s>
<s> Antonio," and there is a book of Dumas' which repeats the objection </s>
<s> I don't think "Fenwick" startling enough </s>
<s> It appears to me that a more startling title would take the (John) Bull by the horns, and would be a serviceable concession to your misgiving, as suggesting a story off the stones of the gas-lighted Brentford Road </s>
<s> The title is the first thing to be settled, and cannot be settled too soon </s>
<s> For the purposes of the weekly publication the divisions of the story will often have to be greatly changed, though afterwards, in the complete book, you can, of course, divide it into chapters, free from that reference </s>
<s> For example: I would end the first chapter on the third slip at "and through the ghostly streets, under the ghostly moon, went back to my solitary room" </s>
<s> The rest of what is now your first chapter might be made Chapter II., and would end the first weekly part </s>
<s> I think I have become, by dint of necessity and practice, rather cunning in this regard; and perhaps you would not mind my looking closely to such points from week to week </s>
<s> It so happens that if you had written the opening of this story expressly for the occasion its striking incidents could not possibly have followed one another better </s>
<s> One other merely mechanical change I suggest now </s>
<s> I would not have an initial letter for the town, but would state in the beginning that I gave the town a fictitious name </s>
<s> I suppose a blank or a dash rather fends a good many people off--because it always has that effect upon me </s>
<s> Be sure that I am perfectly frank and open in all I have said in this note, and that I have not a grain of reservation in my mind </s>
<s> I think the story a very fine one, one that no other man could write, and that there is no strength in your misgiving for the two reasons: firstly, that the work is professedly a work of Fancy and Fiction, in which the reader is not required against his will to take everything for Fact; secondly, that it is written by the man who can write it </s>
<s> The Magician's servant does not know what to do with the ghost, and has, consequently, no business with him </s>
<s> The Magician does know what to do with him, and has all the business with him that he can transact </s>
<s> I am quite at ease on the points that you have expressed yourself as not at ease upon </s>
<s> Quite </s>

<s> 1 </s>
<s> I think you undoubtedly _have_ the right to forbid the turning of your play into an opera </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> I do _not_ think the production of such an opera in the slightest degree likely to injure the play or to render it a less valuable property than it is now </s>
<s> If it could have any effect on so standard and popular a work as "The Lady of Lyons," the effect would, in my judgment, be beneficial </s>
<s> But I believe the play to be high above any such influence </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> Assuming you do consent to the adaptation, in a desire to oblige Oxenford, I would not recommend your asking any pecuniary compensation </s>
<s> This for two reasons: firstly, because the compensation could only be small at the best; secondly, because your taking it would associate you (unreasonably, but not the less assuredly) with the opera </s>
<s> The only objection I descry is purely one of feeling </s>
<s> Pauline trotting about in front of the float, invoking the orchestra with a limp pocket-handkerchief, is a notion that makes goose-flesh of my back </s>
<s> Also a yelping tenor going away to the wars in a scene a half-an-hour long is painful to contemplate </s>
<s> Damas, too, as a bass, with a grizzled bald head, blatently bellowing about Years long ago, When the sound of the drum First made his blood glow With a rum ti tum tum-- rather sticks in my throat; but there really seems to me to be no other objection, if you can get over this </s>

<s> Be sure of it </s>
<s> I came over to France before Georgina and Mary, and went to Boulogne to meet them coming in by the steamer on the great Sunday--the day of the storm </s>
<s> I stood (holding on with both hands) on the pier at Boulogne, five hours </s>
<s> The Sub-Marine Telegraph had telegraphed their boat as having come out of Folkestone--though the companion boat from Boulogne didn't try it--and at nine o'clock at night, she being due at six, there were no signs of her </s>
<s> My principal dread was, that she would try to get into Boulogne; which she could not possibly have done without carrying away everything on deck </s>
<s> The tide at nine o'clock being too low for any such desperate attempt, I thought it likely that they had run for the Downs and would knock about there all night </s>
<s> So I went to the Inn to dry my pea-jacket and get some dinner anxiously enough, when, at about ten, came a telegram from them at Calais to say they had run in there </s>
<s> To Calais I went, post, next morning, expecting to find them half-dead (of course, they had arrived half-drowned), but I found them elaborately got up to come on to Paris by the next Train, and the most wonderful thing of all was, that they hardly seem to have been frightened </s>
<s> Of course, they had discovered at the end of the voyage, that a young bride and her husband, the only other passengers on deck, and with whom they had been talking all the time, were an officer from Chatham whom they knew very well (when dry), just married and going to India </s>
<s> So they all set up house-keeping together at Dessin's at Calais (where I am well known), and looked as if they had been passing a mild summer there </s>
<s> We have a pretty apartment here, but house-rent is awful to mention </s>
<s> Mrs Bouncer (muzzled by the Parisian police) is also here, and is a wonderful spectacle to behold in the streets, restrained like a raging Lion </s>
<s> I learn from an embassy here, that the Emperor has just made an earnest proposal to our Government to unite with France (and Russia, if Russia will) in an appeal to America to stop the brutal war </s>
<s> Our Government's answer is not yet received, but I think I clearly perceive that the proposal will be declined, on the ground "that the time has not yet come" </s>

<s> ---- said (and the other two confirmed) that the _London_ was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale, and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm topsail--which is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent aloft, and can be set under the worst circumstances--the disaster could not have occurred </s>
<s> If he had no such sail, he could have improvised it, even of hammocks and the like </s>
<s> They said that under a Board of Enquiry into the wreck, any efficient witness must of necessity state this as the fact, and could not possibly avoid the conclusion that the seamanship was utterly bad; and as to the force of the wind, for which I suggested allowance, they all had been in West Indian hurricanes and in Typhoons, and had put the heads of their ships to the wind under the most adverse circumstances </s>
<s> I thought you might be interested in this, as you have no doubt been interested in the case </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Anonymous.] GAD'S HILL, _Thursday, 27th December, 1866._ DEAR MADAM,[81] You make an absurd, though common mistake, in supposing that any human creature can help you to be an authoress, if you cannot become one in virtue of your own powers </s>

<s> I know that anyone who can write what is suitable to the requirements of my own journal--for instance--is a person I am heartily glad to discover, and do not very often find </s>
<s> And I believe this to be no rare case in periodical literature </s>

<s> But if you offer anything to me for insertion in "All the Year Round," you may be sure that it will be honestly read, and that it will be judged by no test but its own merits and adaptability to those pages </s>

<s> Your appreciation has given me higher and purer gratification than your modesty can readily believe </s>
<s> When I first entered on this interpretation of myself (then quite strange in the public ear) I was sustained by the hope that I could drop into some hearts, some new expression of the meaning of my books, that would touch them in a new way </s>

<s> PHILLIPS,[83] Although I think the scheme has many good points, I have this doubt: Would boys so maintained at any one of our great public schools stand at a decided disadvantage towards boys not so maintained </s>
<s> Foundation Scholars, in many cases, win their way into public schools and so enforce respect and even assert superiority </s>
<s> In many other cases their patron is a remote and misty person, or Institution, sanctioned by Time and custom </s>

<s> It was clear that the shadow of the end had fallen on him </s>
<s> It happened well that I had seen, on a wild day at Tynemouth, a remarkable sea-effect, of which I wrote a description to him, and he had kept it under his pillow </s>

<s> You shall hear from me fully and finally as soon as Dolby shall have reported personally </s>
<s> The other day I received a letter from Mr ----, of New York (who came over in the winning yacht, and described the voyage in _The Times_), saying he would much like to see me </s>
<s> I made an appointment in London, and observed that when he _did_ see me he was obviously astonished </s>
<s> While I was sensible that the magnificence of my appearance would fully account for his being overcome, I nevertheless angled for the cause of his surprise </s>
<s> He then told me that there was a paragraph going round the papers to the effect that I was "in a critical state of health" </s>
<s> I asked him if he was sure it wasn't "cricketing" state of health </s>
<s> To which he replied, Quite </s>
<s> I then asked him down here to dinner, and he was again staggered by finding me in sporting training; also much amused </s>
<s> Yesterday's and to-day's post bring me this unaccountable paragraph from hosts of uneasy friends, with the enormous and wonderful addition that "eminent surgeons" are sending me to America for "cessation from literary labour"!! </s>
<s> So I have written a quiet line to _The Times_, certifying to my own state of health, and have also begged Dixon to do the like in _The Athenæum_ </s>
<s> I mention the matter to you, in order that you may contradict, from me, if the nonsense should reach America unaccompanied by the truth </s>
<s> But I suppose that _The New York Herald_ will probably have got the letter from Mr ---- aforesaid </s>

<s> Charles Reade and Wilkie Collins are here; and the joke of the time is to feel my pulse when I appear at table, and also to inveigle innocent messengers to come over to the summer-house, where I write (the place is quite changed since you were here, and a tunnel under the highroad connects this shrubbery with the front garden), to ask, with their compliments, how I find myself _now_ </s>
<s> If I come to America this next November, even you can hardly imagine with what interest I shall try Copperfield on an American audience, or, if they give me their heart, how freely and fully I shall give them mine </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Lord Lytton.] "ALL THE YEAR ROUND" OFFICE, _Tuesday, 17th September, 1867._ MY DEAR LYTTON, I am happy to tell you that the play was admirably done last night, and made a marked impression </s>
<s> Pauline is weak, but so carefully trained and fitted into the picture as to be never disagreeable, and sometimes (as in the last scene) very pathetic </s>
<s> Fechter has played nothing nearly so well as Claude since he played in Paris in the "Dame aux Camélias," or in London as Ruy Blas </s>
<s> He played the fourth act as finely as Macready, and the first much better </s>
<s> The dress and bearing in the fifth act are quite new, and quite excellent </s>
<s> Of the Scenic arrangements, the most noticeable are:--the picturesque struggle of the cottage between the taste of an artist, and the domestic means of poverty (expressed to the eye with infinite tact);--the view of Lyons (Act v </s>
<s> Scene 1), with a foreground of quay wall which the officers are leaning on, waiting for the general;--and the last scene--a suite of rooms giving on a conservatory at the back, through which the moon is shining </s>
<s> You are to understand that all these scenic appliances are subdued to the Piece, instead of the Piece being sacrificed to them; and that every group and situation has to be considered, not only with a reference to each by itself, but to the whole story </s>
<s> Beauséant's speaking the original contents of the letter was a decided point, and the immense house was quite breathless when the Tempter and the Tempted stood confronted as he made the proposal </s>
<s> There was obviously a great interest in seeing a Frenchman play the part </s>
<s> The scene between Claude and Gaspar (the small part very well done) was very closely watched for the same reason, and was loudly applauded </s>
<s> I cannot say too much of the brightness, intelligence, picturesqueness, and care of Fechter's impersonation throughout </s>
<s> There was a remarkable delicacy in his gradually drooping down on his way home with his bride, until he fell upon the table, a crushed heap of shame and remorse, while his mother told Pauline the story </s>
<s> His gradual recovery of himself as he formed better resolutions was equally well expressed; and his being at last upright again and rushing enthusiastically to join the army, brought the house down </s>
<s> I wish you could have been there </s>
<s> He never spoke English half so well as he spoke your English; and the audience heard it with the finest sympathy and respect </s>
<s> I felt that I should have been very proud indeed to have been the writer of the Play </s>
<s> Ever affectionately </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Mr James T </s>
<s> Fields.] [86]_October, 1867._ MY DEAR FIELDS, I hope the telegraph clerks did not mutilate out of recognition or reasonable guess the words I added to Dolby's last telegram to Boston </s>
<s> "_Tribune_ London correspondent totally false" </s>
<s> Not only is there not a word of truth in the pretended conversation, but it is so absurdly unlike me that I cannot suppose it to be even invented by anyone who ever heard me exchange a word with mortal creature </s>
<s> For twenty years I am perfectly certain that I have never made any other allusion to the republication of my books in America than the good-humoured remark, "that if there had been international copyright between England and the States, I should have been a man of very large fortune, instead of a man of moderate savings, always supporting a very expensive public position" </s>
<s> Nor have I ever been such a fool as to charge the absence of international copyright upon individuals </s>
<s> Nor have I ever been so ungenerous as to disguise or suppress the fact that I have received handsome sums for advance sheets </s>
<s> When I was in the States, I said what I had to say on the question, and there an end </s>
<s> I am absolutely certain that I have never since expressed myself, even with soreness, on the subject </s>
<s> Reverting to the preposterous fabrication of the London correspondent, the statement that I ever talked about "these fellows" who republished my books or pretended to know (what I don't know at this instant) who made how much out of them, or ever talked of their sending me "conscience money," is as grossly and completely false as the statement that I ever said anything to the effect that I could not be expected to have an interest in the American people </s>
<s> And nothing can by any possibility be falser than that </s>
<s> Again and again in these pages ("All the Year Round") I have expressed my interest in them </s>
<s> You will see it in the "Child's History of England" </s>
<s> You will see it in the last preface to "American Notes" </s>
<s> Every American who has ever spoken with me in London, Paris, or where not, knows whether I have frankly said, "You could have no better introduction to me than your country" </s>
<s> And for years and years when I have been asked about reading in America, my invariable reply has been, "I have so many friends there, and constantly receive so many earnest letters from personally unknown readers there, that, but for domestic reasons, I would go to-morrow" </s>
<s> I think I must, in the confidential intercourse between you and me, have written you to this effect more than once </s>
<s> The statement of the London correspondent from beginning to end is false </s>
<s> It is false in the letter and false in the spirit </s>
<s> He may have been misinformed, and the statement may not have originated with him </s>
<s> With whomsoever it originated, it never originated with me, and consequently is false </s>
<s> More than enough about it </s>
<s> As I hope to see you so soon, my dear Fields, and as I am busily at work on the Christmas number, I will not make this a longer letter than I can help </s>
<s> I thank you most heartily for your proffered hospitality, and need not tell you that if I went to any friend's house in America, I would go to yours </s>
<s> But the readings are very hard work, and I think I cannot do better than observe the rule on that side of the Atlantic which I observe on this, of never, under such circumstances, going to a friend's house, but always staying at a hotel </s>
<s> I am able to observe it here, by being consistent and never breaking it </s>
<s> If I am equally consistent there, I can (I hope) offend no one </s>
<s> Dolby sends his love to you and all his friends (as I do), and is girding up his loins vigorously </s>

<s> [Sidenote: Lord Lytton.] GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT, _Monday, 14th October, 1867._ MY DEAR LYTTON, I am truly delighted to find that you are so well pleased with Fechter in "The Lady of Lyons" </s>
<s> It was a labour of love with him, and I hold him in very high regard </s>
<s> _Don't_ give way to laziness, and _do_ proceed with that play </s>
<s> There never was a time when a good new play was more wanted, or had a better opening for itself </s>
<s> Fechter is a thorough artist, and what he may sometimes want in personal force is compensated by the admirable whole he can make of a play, and his perfect understanding of its presentation as a picture to the eye and mind </s>
<s> I leave London on the 8th of November early, and sail from Liverpool on the 9th </s>
<s> Ever affectionately yours </s>
<s> [Sidenote: The same.] "ALL THE YEAR ROUND" OFFICE, _Friday, 25th October, 1867._ MY DEAR LYTTON, I have read the Play[88] with great attention, interest, and admiration; and I need not say to _you_ that the art of it--the fine construction--the exquisite nicety of the touches--with which it is wrought out--have been a study to me in the pursuit of which I have had extraordinary relish </s>
<s> Taking the Play as it stands, I have nothing whatever to add to your notes and memoranda of the points to be touched again, except that I have a little uneasiness in that burst of anger and inflexibility consequent on having been deceived, coming out of Hegio </s>
<s> I see the kind of actor who _must_ play Hegio, and I see that the audience will not believe in his doing anything so serious </s>
<s> (I suppose it would be impossible to get this effect out of the mother--or through the mother's influence, instead of out of the godfather of Hegiopolis?) Now, as to the classical ground and manners of the Play </s>
<s> I suppose the objection to the Greek dress to be already--as Defoe would write it, "gotten over" by your suggestion </s>
<s> I suppose the dress not to be conventionally associated with stilts and boredom, but to be new to the public eye and very picturesque </s>
<s> Grant all that;--the names remain </s>
<s> Now, not only used such names to be inseparable in the public mind from stately weariness, but of late days they have become inseparable in the same public mind from silly puns upon the names, and from Burlesque </s>
<s> You do not know (I hope, at least, for my friend's sake) what the Strand Theatre is </s>
<s> A Greek name and a break-down nigger dance, have become inseparable there </s>
<s> I do not mean to say that your genius may not be too powerful for such associations; but I do most positively mean to say that you would lose half the play in overcoming them </s>
<s> At the best you would have to contend against them through the first three acts </s>
<s> The old tendency to become frozen on classical ground would be in the best part of the audience; the new tendency to titter on such ground would be in the worst part </s>
<s> And instead of starting fair with the audience, it is my conviction that you would start with them against you and would have to win them over </s>
<s> Furthermore, with reference to your note to me on this head, you take up a position with reference to poor dear Talfourd's "Ion" which I altogether dispute </s>
<s> It never was a popular play, I say </s>
<s> It derived a certain amount of out-of-door's popularity from the circumstances under which, and the man by whom, it was written </s>
<s> But I say that it never was a popular play on the Stage, and never made out a case of attraction there </s>
<s> As to changing the ground to Russia, let me ask you, did you ever see the "Nouvelles Russes" of Nicolas Gogol, translated into French by Louis Viardot </s>
<s> There is a story among them called "Tarass Boulla," in which, as it seems to me, all the conditions you want for such transplantation are to be found </s>
<s> So changed, you would have the popular sympathy with the Slave or Serf, or Prisoner of War, from the first </s>
<s> But I do not think it is to be got, save at great hazard, and with lamentable waste of force on the ground the Play now occupies </s>
<s> I shall keep this note until to-morrow to correct my conviction if I can see the least reason for correcting it; but I feel very confident indeed that I cannot be shaken in it </s>
<s> * * * * * _Saturday._ I have thought it over again, and have gone over the play again with an imaginary stage and actors before me, and I am still of the same mind </s>

<s> FIELDS, As you ask me about the dogs, I begin with them </s>
<s> When I came down first, I came to Gravesend, five miles off </s>
<s> The two Newfoundland dogs, coming to meet me with the usual carriage and the usual driver, and beholding me coming in my usual dress out at the usual door, it struck me that their recollection of my having been absent for any unusual time was at once cancelled </s>
<s> They behaved (they are both young dogs) exactly in their usual manner; coming behind the basket phaeton as we trotted along, and lifting their heads to have their ears pulled--a special attention which they receive from no one else </s>
<s> But when I drove into the stable-yard, Linda (the St </s>
<s> Bernard) was greatly excited; weeping profusely, and throwing herself on her back that she might caress my foot with her great fore-paws </s>
<s> Mamie's little dog, too, Mrs Bouncer, barked in the greatest agitation on being called down and asked by Mamie, "Who is this" </s>
<s> and tore round and round me, like the dog in the Faust outlines </s>
<s> You must know that all the farmers turned out on the road in their market-chaises to say, "Welcome home, sir" </s>
<s> and that all the houses along the road were dressed with flags; and that our servants, to cut out the rest, had dressed this house so that every brick of it was hidden </s>
<s> They had asked Mamie's permission to "ring the alarm-bell" (!) when master drove up, but Mamie, having some slight idea that that compliment might awaken master's sense of the ludicrous, had recommended bell abstinence </s>
<s> But on Sunday the village choir (which includes the bell-ringers) made amends </s>
<s> After some unusually brief pious reflections in the crowns of their hats at the end of the sermon, the ringers bolted out, and rang like mad until I got home </s>
<s> There had been a conspiracy among the villagers to take the horse out, if I had come to our own station, and draw me here </s>
<s> Mamie and Georgy had got wind of it and warned me </s>
<s> Divers birds sing here all day, and the nightingales all night </s>
<s> The place is lovely, and in perfect order </s>
<s> I have put five mirrors in the Swiss châlet (where I write) and they reflect and refract in all kinds of ways the leaves that are quivering at the windows, and the great fields of waving corn, and the sail-dotted river </s>
<s> My room is up among the branches of the trees; and the birds and the butterflies fly in and out, and the green branches shoot in, at the open windows, and the lights and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of the company </s>
<s> The scent of the flowers, and indeed of everything that is growing for miles and miles, is most delicious </s>
<s> Dolby (who sends a world of messages) found his wife much better than he expected, and the children (wonderful to relate!) perfect </s>

<s> I am brown beyond belief, and cause the greatest disappointment in all quarters by looking so well </s>

<s> My doctor was quite broken down in spirits when he saw me, for the first time since my return, last Saturday </s>
<s> "Good Lord" </s>
<s> he said, recoiling, "seven years younger" </s>
<s> It is time I should explain the otherwise inexplicable enclosure </s>

<s> "No Thoroughfare" is very shortly coming out in Paris, where it is now in active rehearsal </s>
<s> It is still playing here, but without Fechter, who has been very ill </s>
<s> The doctor's dismissal of him to Paris, however, and his getting better there, enables him to get up the play there </s>
<s> He and Wilkie missed so many pieces of stage-effect here, that, unless I am quite satisfied with his report, I shall go over and try my stage-managerial hand at the Vaudeville Theatre </s>
<s> I particularly want the drugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene at the Swiss inn to be done to the sound of a waterfall rising and falling with the wind </s>

<s> When he was in London the first time he came and went without reporting himself, and left me in a state of unspeakable discomfiture </s>
<s> Indeed, I should not have believed in his having been here at all, if Mrs Procter had not told me of his calling to see Procter </s>
<s> However, on his return he wrote to me from the Langham Hotel, and I went up to town to see him, and to make an appointment for his coming here </s>
<s> He, the girls, and Appleton, came down last Saturday night and stayed until Monday forenoon </s>
<s> I showed them all the neighbouring country that could be shown in so short a time, and they finished off with a tour of inspection of the kitchens, pantry, wine-cellar, pickles, sauces, servants' sitting-room, general household stores, and even the Cellar Book, of this illustrious establishment </s>
<s> Forster and Kent (the latter wrote certain verses to Longfellow, which have been published in _The Times_, and which I sent to D----) came down for a day, and I hope we all had a really "good time" </s>
<s> I turned out a couple of postillions in the old red jacket of the old red royal Dover Road, for our ride; and it was like a holiday ride in England fifty years ago </s>
<s> Of course we went to look at the old houses in Rochester, and the old cathedral, and the old castle, and the house for the six poor travellers who, "not being rogues or procters, shall have lodging, entertainment, and four pence each" </s>
<s> Nothing can surpass the respect paid to Longfellow here, from the Queen downward </s>
<s> He is everywhere received and courted, and finds (as I told him he would, when we talked of it in Boston) the working-men at least as well acquainted with his books as the classes socially above them </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> Last Thursday I attended, as sponsor, the christening of Dolby's son and heir--a most jolly baby, who held on tight by the rector's left whisker while the service was performed </s>
<s> What time, too, his little sister, connecting me with the pony, trotted up and down the centre aisle, noisily driving herself as that celebrated animal, so that it went very hard with the sponsorial dignity </s>
<s> Wills is not yet recovered from that concussion of the brain, and I have all his work to do </s>
<s> This may account for my not being able to devise a Christmas number, but I seem to have left my invention in America </s>
<s> In case you should find it, please send it over </s>
<s> I am going up to town to-day to dine with Longfellow </s>
<s> And now, my dear Fields, you know all about me and mine </s>
<s> You are enjoying your holiday </s>
<s> and are still thinking sometimes of our Boston days, as I do </s>
<s> and are maturing schemes for coming here next summer </s>
<s> A satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly entreated </s>
<s> I am delighted to find you both so well pleased with the Blind Book scheme.[94] I said nothing of it to you when we were together, though I had made up my mind, because I wanted to come upon you with that little burst from a distance </s>
<s> It seemed something like meeting again when I remitted the money and thought of your talking of it </s>
<s> The dryness of the weather is amazing </s>
<s> All the ponds and surface-wells about here are waterless, and the poor people suffer greatly </s>
<s> The people of this village have only one spring to resort to, and it is a couple of miles from many cottages </s>
<s> I do not let the great dogs swim in the canal, because the people have to drink of it </s>
<s> But when they get into the Medway it is hard to get them out again </s>
<s> The other day Bumble (the son, Newfoundland dog) got into difficulties among some floating timber, and became frightened </s>
<s> Don (the father) was standing by me, shaking off the wet and looking on carelessly, when all of a sudden he perceived something amiss, and went in with a bound and brought Bumble out by the ear </s>

<s> Some Massachusetts men do believe in such a thing, but they fail (as I think) to take into account the prompt western opposition </s>
<s> Such an alteration as you suggest in the English law would give no copyright in America, you see </s>
<s> The American publisher could buy no absolute _right_ of priority </s>
<s> Any American newspaper could (and many would, in a popular case) pirate from him, as soon as they could get the matter set up </s>
<s> He could buy no more than he buys now when he arranges for advance sheets from England, so that there may be simultaneous publication in the two countries </s>
<s> And success in England is of so much importance towards the achievement of success in America, that I greatly doubt whether previous publications in America would often be worth more to an American publisher or manager than simultaneous publication </s>
<s> Concerning the literary man in Parliament who would undertake to bring in a Bill for such an amendment of our copyright law, with weight enough to keep his heart unbroken while he should be getting it through its various lingering miseries, all I can say is--I decidedly don't know him </s>

<s> FIELDS, </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> First, as you are curious about the Oliver murder, I will tell you about that trial of the same at which you _ought_ to have assisted </s>
<s> There were about a hundred people present in all </s>
<s> I have changed my stage </s>
<s> Besides that back screen which you know so well, there are two large screens of the same colour, set off, one on either side, like the "wings" at a theatre </s>
<s> And besides these again, we have a quantity of curtains of the same colour, with which to close in any width of room from wall to wall </s>
<s> Consequently, the figure is now completely isolated, and the slightest action becomes much more important </s>
<s> This was used for the first time on the occasion </s>
<s> But behind the stage--the orchestra being very large and built for the accommodation of a numerous chorus--there was ready, on the level of the platform, a very long table, beautifully lighted, with a large staff of men ready to open oysters and set champagne-corks flying </s>
<s> Directly I had done, the screens being whisked off by my people, there was disclosed one of the prettiest banquets you can imagine; and when all the people came up, and the gay dresses of the ladies were lighted by those powerful lights of mine, the scene was exquisitely pretty; the hall being newly decorated, and very elegantly; and the whole looking like a great bed of flowers and diamonds </s>
<s> Now, you must know that all this company were, before the wine went round, unmistakably pale, and had horror-stricken faces </s>
<s> Next morning Harness (Fields knows--Rev </s>
<s> William--did an edition of Shakespeare--old friend of the Kembles and Mrs Siddons), writing to me about it, and saying it was "a most amazing and terrific thing," added, "but I am bound to tell you that I had an almost irresistible impulse upon me to _scream_, and that, if anyone had cried out, I am certain I should have followed" </s>
<s> He had no idea that, on the night, P----, the great ladies' doctor, had taken me aside and said: "My dear Dickens, you may rely upon it that if only one woman cries out when you murder the girl, there will be a contagion of hysteria all over this place" </s>
<s> It is impossible to soften it without spoiling it, and you may suppose that I am rather anxious to discover how it goes on the 5th of January!! </s>
<s> We are afraid to announce it elsewhere, without knowing, except that I have thought it pretty safe to put it up once in Dublin </s>
<s> I asked Mrs K----, the famous actress, who was at the experiment: "What do _you_ say </s>
<s> Do it or not" </s>
<s> "Why, of course, do it," she replied </s>
<s> "Having got at such an effect as that, it must be done </s>
<s> But," rolling her large black eyes very slowly, and speaking very distinctly, "the public have been looking out for a sensation these last fifty years or so, and by Heaven they have got it" </s>
<s> With which words, and a long breath and a long stare, she became speechless </s>
<s> Again, you may suppose that I am a little anxious </s>
<s> Not a day passes but Dolby and I talk about you both, and recall where we were at the corresponding time of last year </s>
<s> My old likening of Boston to Edinburgh has been constantly revived within these last ten days </s>
<s> There is a certain remarkable similarity of _tone_ between the two places </s>
<s> The audiences are curiously alike, except that the Edinburgh audience has a quicker sense of humour and is a little more genial </s>
<s> No disparagement to Boston in this, because I consider an Edinburgh audience perfect </s>
<s> I trust, my dear Eugenius, that you have recognised yourself in a certain Uncommercial, and also some small reference to a name rather dear to you </s>
<s> As an instance of how strangely something comic springs up in the midst of the direst misery, look to a succeeding Uncommercial, called "A Small Star in the East," published to-day, by-the-bye </s>
<s> I have described, _with exactness_, the poor places into which I went, and how the people behaved, and what they said </s>
<s> I was wretched, looking on; and yet the boiler-maker and the poor man with the legs filled me with a sense of drollery not to be kept down by any pressure </s>
<s> The atmosphere of this place, compounded of mists from the highlands and smoke from the town factories, is crushing my eyebrows as I write, and it rains as it never does rain anywhere else, and always does rain here </s>
<s> It is a dreadful place, though much improved and possessing a deal of public spirit </s>
<s> Improvement is beginning to knock the old town of Edinburgh about, here and there; but the Canongate and the most picturesque of the horrible courts and wynds are not to be easily spoiled, or made fit for the poor wretches who people them to live in </s>
<s> Edinburgh is so changed as to its notabilities, that I had the only three men left of the Wilson and Jeffrey time to dine with me there, last Saturday </s>

<s> I rather think that when the 12th of June shall have shaken off these shackles,[102] there _will_ be borage on the lawn at Gad's </s>
<s> Your heart's desire in that matter, and in the minor particulars of Cobham Park, Rochester Castle, and Canterbury, shall be fulfilled, please God </s>

<s> The latter wrote by the same mail, on behalf of both, expressing the warmest gratitude to you, and reporting himself in the stoutest heart and hope </s>
<s> I never can thank you sufficiently </s>
<s> You will see that the new Ministry has made a decided hit with its Budget, and that in the matter of the Irish Church it has the country at its back </s>
<s> You will also see that the "Reform League" has dissolved itself, indisputably because it became aware that the people did not want it </s>
<s> I think the general feeling in England is a desire to get the Irish Church out of the way of many social reforms, and to have it done _with_ as already done _for_ </s>
<s> I do not in the least believe myself that agrarian Ireland is to be pacified by any such means, or can have it got out of its mistaken head that the land is of right the peasantry's, and that every man who owns land has stolen it and is therefore to be shot </s>
<s> But that is not the question </s>
<s> The clock strikes post-time as I write, and I fear to write more, lest, at this distance from London, I should imperil the next mail </s>

<s> CHAPPELL, I am really touched by your letter </s>
<s> I can most truthfully assure you that your part in the inconvenience of this mishap has given me much more concern than my own; and that if I did not hope to have our London Farewells yet, I should be in a very gloomy condition on your account </s>
<s> Pray do not suppose that _you_ are to blame for my having done a little too much--a wild fancy indeed </s>
<s> The simple fact is, that the rapid railway travelling was stretched a hair's breadth too far, and that _I_ ought to have foreseen it </s>
<s> For, on the night before the last night of our reading in America, when Dolby was cheering me with a review of the success, and the immediate prospect of the voyage home, I told him, to his astonishment: "I am too far gone, and too worn out to realise anything but my own exhaustion </s>
<s> Believe me, if I had to read but twice more, instead of once, I couldn't do it" </s>
<s> We were then just beyond our recent number </s>
<s> And it was the travelling that I had felt throughout </s>
<s> The sharp precautionary remedy of stopping instantly, was almost as instantly successful the other day </s>
<s> I told Dr </s>
<s> Watson that he had never seen me knocked out of time, and that he had no idea of the rapidity with which I should come up again </s>
<s> Just as three days' repose on the Atlantic steamer made me, in my altered appearance, the amazement of the captain, so this last week has set me up, thank God, in the most wonderful manner </s>
<s> The sense of exhaustion seems a dream already </s>
<s> Of course I shall train myself carefully, nevertheless, all through the summer and autumn </s>
<s> I beg to send my kind regards to Mrs Chappell, and I shall hope to see her and you at Teddington in the long bright days </s>
<s> It would disappoint me indeed if a lasting friendship did not come of our business relations </s>
<s> In the spring I trust I shall be able to report to you that I am ready to take my Farewells in London </s>
<s> Of this I am pretty certain: that I never will take them at all, unless with you on your own conditions </s>
<s> With an affectionate regard for you and your brother, believe me always, Very faithfully yours </s>

<s> I daresay I _should_ have been very ill if I had not suddenly stopped my Farewell Readings when there were yet five-and-twenty remaining to be given </s>
<s> I was quite exhausted, and was warned by the doctors to stop (for the time) instantly </s>
<s> Acting on the advice, and going home into Kent for rest, I immediately began to recover, and within a fortnight was in the brilliant condition in which I can now--thank God--report myself </s>
<s> I cannot thank you enough for your care of Plorn </s>

<s> I still hope that he may take to colonial life </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> In his letter to me about his leaving the station to which he got through your kindness, he expresses his gratitude to you quite as strongly as if he had made a wonderful success, and seems to have acquired no distaste for anything but the one individual of whom he wrote that betrayed letter </s>
<s> But knowing the boy, I want to try him fully </s>
<s> You know all our public news, such as it is, at least as well as I do </s>
<s> Many people here (of whom I am one) do not like the look of American matters </s>
<s> What I most fear is that the perpetual bluster of a party in the States will at last set the patient British back up </s>
<s> And if our people begin to bluster too, and there should come into existence an exasperating war-party on both sides, there will be great danger of a daily-widening breach </s>

<s> I think your title open to the same objection, and therefore propose to substitute: THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JOHN ACLAND </s>
<s> This will leave the reader in doubt whether he really _was_ murdered, until the end </s>

<s> Said correspondent has evidently read the story--and is almost confident in "Chambers's Journal" </s>
<s> This is very unfortunate, but of course cannot be helped </s>
<s> There is always a possibility of such a malignant conjunction of stars when the story is a true one </s>
<s> In the case of a good story--as this is--liable for years to be told at table--as this was--there is nothing wonderful in such a mischance </s>
<s> Let us shuffle the cards, as Sancho says, and begin again </s>
<s> You will of course understand that I do not tell you this by way of complaint </s>
<s> Indeed, I should not have mentioned it at all, but as an explanation to you of my reason for winding the story up (which I have done to-day) as expeditiously as possible </s>
<s> You might otherwise have thought me, on reading it as published, a little hard on Mr Doilly </s>
<s> I have not had time to direct search to be made in "Chambers's;" but as to the main part of the story having been printed somewhere, I have not the faintest doubt </s>

<s> RUSDEN, This very day a great meeting is announced to come off in London, as a demonstration in favour of a Fenian "amnesty" </s>
<s> No doubt its numbers and importance are ridiculously over-estimated, but I believe the gathering will turn out to be big enough to be a very serious obstruction in the London streets </s>
<s> I have a great doubt whether such demonstrations ought to be allowed </s>
<s> They are bad as a precedent, and they unquestionably interfere with the general liberty and freedom of the subject </s>
<s> Moreover, the time must come when this kind of threat and defiance will have to be forcibly stopped, and when the unreasonable toleration of it will lead to a sacrifice of life among the comparatively innocent lookers-on that might have been avoided but for a false confidence on their part, engendered in the damnable system of _laisser-aller_ </s>
<s> You see how right we were, you and I, in our last correspondence on this head, and how desperately unsatisfactory the condition of Ireland is, especially when considered with a reference to America </s>
<s> The Government has, through Mr Gladstone, just now spoken out boldly in reference to the desired amnesty </s>
<s> (So much the better for them or they would unquestionably have gone by the board.) Still there is an uneasy feeling abroad that Mr Gladstone himself would grant this amnesty if he dared, and that there is a great weakness in the rest of their Irish policy </s>
<s> And this feeling is very strong amongst the noisiest Irish howlers </s>
<s> Meanwhile, the newspapers go on arguing Irish matters as if the Irish were a reasonable people, in which immense assumption I, for one, have not the smallest faith </s>
<s> Again, I have to thank you most heartily for your kindness to my two boys </s>
<s> It is impossible to predict how Plorn will settle down, or come out of the effort to do so </s>
<s> But he has unquestionably an affectionate nature, and a certain romantic touch in him </s>
<s> Both of these qualities are, I hope, more impressible for good than for evil, and I trust in God for the rest </s>
<s> The news of Lord Derby's death will reach you, I suppose, at about the same time as this letter </s>
<s> A rash, impetuous, passionate man; but a great loss for his party, as a man of mind and mark </s>

<s> As this need not be posted till Friday, I shall leave it open for a final word or two; and am until then, and then, and always afterwards, my dear Mr Rusden, Your faithful and much obliged </s>
<s> _Thursday, 28th._ We have no news in England except two slight changes in the Government consequent on Layard's becoming our Minister at Madrid </s>
<s> He is not long married to a charming lady, and will be far better in Spain than in the House of Commons </s>
<s> The Ministry are now holding councils on the Irish Land Tenure question, which is the next difficulty they have to deal with, as you know </s>
<s> Last Sunday's meeting was a preposterous failure; still, it brought together in the streets of London all the ruffian part of the population of London, and that is a serious evil which any one of a thousand accidents might render mischievous </s>
<s> There is no existing law, however, to stop these assemblages, so that they keep moving while in the streets </s>

<s> I was not mistaken </s>
<s> The same arguing of the squatter question--vegetables and all--appeared </s>
<s> This gave me an opportunity of touching on those points by this mail, without in the least compromising you </s>
<s> I cannot too completely express my concurrence with your excellent idea that his correspondence with you should be regarded as confidential </s>
<s> Just as I could not possibly suggest a word more neatly to the point, or more thoughtfully addressed, to such a young man than your reply to his letter, I hope you will excuse my saying that it is a perfect model of tact, good sense, and good feeling </s>
<s> I had been struck by his persistently ignoring the possibility of his holding any other position in Australasia than his present position, and had inferred from it a homeward tendency </s>
<s> What is most curious to me is that he is very sensible, and yet does not seem to understand that he has qualified himself for no public examinations in the old country, and could not possibly hold his own against any competition for anything to which I could get him nominated </s>
<s> But I must not trouble you about my boys as if they were yours </s>
<s> It is enough that I can never thank you for your goodness to them in a generous consideration of me </s>
<s> I believe the truth as to France to be that a citizen Frenchman never forgives, and that Napoleon will never live down the _coup d'état_ </s>
<s> This makes it enormously difficult for any well-advised English newspaper to support him, and pretend not to know on what a volcano his throne is set </s>
<s> Informed as to his designs on the one hand, and the perpetual uneasiness of his police on the other (to say nothing of a doubtful army), _The Times_ has a difficult game to play </s>
<s> My own impression is that if it were played too boldly for him, the old deplorable national antagonism would revive in his going down </s>
<s> That the wind will pass over his Imperiality on the sands of France I have not the slightest doubt </s>
<s> In no country on the earth, but least of all there, can you seize people in their houses on political warrants, and kill in the streets, on no warrant at all, without raising a gigantic Nemesis--not very reasonable in detail, perhaps, but none the less terrible for that </s>
<s> The commonest dog or man driven mad is a much more alarming creature than the same individuality in a sober and commonplace condition </s>
<s> Your friend ---- ---- is setting the world right generally all round (including the flattened ends, the two poles), and, as a Minister said to me the other day, "has the one little fault of omniscience" </s>
<s> You will probably have read before now that I am going to be everything the Queen can make me.[111] If my authority be worth anything believe on it that I am going to be nothing but what I am, and that that includes my being as long as I live, Your faithful and heartily obliged </s>
<s> [Sidenote: Mr Alfred Tennyson Dickens.] ATHENÆUM CLUB, _Friday Night, 20th May, 1870._ MY DEAR ALFRED,[112] I have just time to tell you under my own hand that I invited Mr Bear to a dinner of such guests as he would naturally like to see, and that we took to him very much, and got on with him capitally </s>
<s> I am doubtful whether Plorn is taking to Australia </s>
<s> Can you find out his real mind </s>
<s> I notice that he always writes as if his present life were the be-all and the end-all of his emigration, and as if I had no idea of you two becoming proprietors, and aspiring to the first positions in the colony, without casting off the old connection </s>
<s> From Mr Bear I had the best accounts of you </s>
<s> I told him that they did not surprise me, for I had unbounded faith in you </s>
<s> For which take my love and blessing </s>
<s> They will have told you all the news here, and that I am hard at work </s>
<s> This is not a letter so much as an assurance that I never think of you without hope and comfort </s>
<s> Ever, my dear Alfred, Your affectionate Father </s>
