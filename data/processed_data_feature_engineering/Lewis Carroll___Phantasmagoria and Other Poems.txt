<s> "And as to being in a fright, Allow me to remark That Ghosts have just as good a right In every way, to fear the light, As Men to fear the dark" </s>

<s> "No doubt," said I, "they settled who Was fittest to be sent Yet still to choose a brat like you, To haunt a man of forty-two, Was no great compliment" </s>

<s> "The Third was written to protect The interests of the Victim, And tells us, as I recollect, TO TREAT HIM WITH A GRAVE RESPECT, AND NOT TO CONTRADICT HIM" </s>
<s> "That's plain," said I, "as Tare and Tret, To any comprehension: I only wish SOME Ghosts I've met Would not so CONSTANTLY forget The maxim that you mention" </s>
<s> "Perhaps," he said, "YOU first transgressed The laws of hospitality: All Ghosts instinctively detest The Man that fails to treat his guest With proper cordiality </s>
<s> "If you address a Ghost as 'Thing' </s>

<s> HIAWATHA'S PHOTOGRAPHING [In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy </s>
<s> Any fairly practised writer, with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours together, in the easy running metre of 'The Song of Hiawatha' </s>
<s> Having, then, distinctly stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject.] From his shoulder Hiawatha Took the camera of rosewood, Made of sliding, folding rosewood; Neatly put it all together </s>
<s> In its case it lay compactly, Folded into nearly nothing; But he opened out the hinges, Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges, Till it looked all squares and oblongs, Like a complicated figure In the Second Book of Euclid </s>
<s> This he perched upon a tripod - Crouched beneath its dusky cover - Stretched his hand, enforcing silence - Said, "Be motionless, I beg you" </s>
<s> Mystic, awful was the process </s>
<s> All the family in order Sat before him for their pictures: Each in turn, as he was taken, Volunteered his own suggestions, His ingenious suggestions </s>
<s> First the Governor, the Father: He suggested velvet curtains Looped about a massy pillar; And the corner of a table, Of a rosewood dining-table </s>
<s> He would hold a scroll of something, Hold it firmly in his left-hand; He would keep his right-hand buried (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat; He would contemplate the distance With a look of pensive meaning, As of ducks that die ill tempests </s>
<s> Grand, heroic was the notion: Yet the picture failed entirely: Failed, because he moved a little, Moved, because he couldn't help it </s>
<s> Next, his better half took courage; SHE would have her picture taken </s>
<s> She came dressed beyond description, Dressed in jewels and in satin Far too gorgeous for an empress </s>
<s> Gracefully she sat down sideways, With a simper scarcely human, Holding in her hand a bouquet Rather larger than a cabbage </s>
<s> All the while that she was sitting, Still the lady chattered, chattered, Like a monkey in the forest </s>
<s> "Am I sitting still" </s>
<s> she asked him </s>
<s> "Is my face enough in profile </s>
<s> Shall I hold the bouquet higher </s>
<s> Will it came into the picture" </s>
<s> And the picture failed completely </s>
<s> Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab: He suggested curves of beauty, Curves pervading all his figure, Which the eye might follow onward, Till they centered in the breast-pin, Centered in the golden breast-pin </s>
<s> He had learnt it all from Ruskin (Author of 'The Stones of Venice,' 'Seven Lamps of Architecture,' 'Modern Painters,' and some others); And perhaps he had not fully Understood his author's meaning; But, whatever was the reason, All was fruitless, as the picture Ended in an utter failure </s>
<s> Next to him the eldest daughter: She suggested very little, Only asked if he would take her With her look of 'passive beauty' </s>
<s> Her idea of passive beauty Was a squinting of the left-eye, Was a drooping of the right-eye, Was a smile that went up sideways To the corner of the nostrils </s>
<s> Hiawatha, when she asked him, Took no notice of the question, Looked as if he hadn't heard it; But, when pointedly appealed to, Smiled in his peculiar manner, Coughed and said it 'didn't matter,' Bit his lip and changed the subject </s>
<s> Nor in this was he mistaken, As the picture failed completely </s>
<s> So in turn the other sisters </s>
<s> Last, the youngest son was taken: Very rough and thick his hair was, Very round and red his face was, Very dusty was his jacket, Very fidgety his manner </s>
<s> And his overbearing sisters Called him names he disapproved of: Called him Johnny, 'Daddy's Darling,' Called him Jacky, 'Scrubby School-boy' </s>
<s> And, so awful was the picture, In comparison the others Seemed, to one's bewildered fancy, To have partially succeeded </s>
<s> Finally my Hiawatha Tumbled all the tribe together, ('Grouped' is not the right expression), And, as happy chance would have it Did at last obtain a picture Where the faces all succeeded: Each came out a perfect likeness </s>
<s> Then they joined and all abused it, Unrestrainedly abused it, As the worst and ugliest picture They could possibly have dreamed of </s>
<s> 'Giving one such strange expressions - Sullen, stupid, pert expressions </s>
<s> Really any one would take us (Any one that did not know us) For the most unpleasant people' </s>
<s> (Hiawatha seemed to think so, Seemed to think it not unlikely) </s>
<s> All together rang their voices, Angry, loud, discordant voices, As of dogs that howl in concert, As of cats that wail in chorus </s>
<s> But my Hiawatha's patience, His politeness and his patience, Unaccountably had vanished, And he left that happy party </s>
<s> Neither did he leave them slowly, With the calm deliberation, The intense deliberation Of a photographic artist: But he left them in a hurry, Left them in a mighty hurry, Stating that he would not stand it, Stating in emphatic language What he'd be before he'd stand it </s>
<s> Hurriedly he packed his boxes: Hurriedly the porter trundled On a barrow all his boxes: Hurriedly he took his ticket: Hurriedly the train received him: Thus departed Hiawatha </s>
<s> MELANCHOLETTA With saddest music all day long She soothed her secret sorrow: At night she sighed "I fear 'twas wrong Such cheerful words to borrow </s>
<s> Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song I'll sing to thee to-morrow" </s>
<s> I thanked her, but I could not say That I was glad to hear it: I left the house at break of day, And did not venture near it Till time, I hoped, had worn away Her grief, for nought could cheer it </s>
<s> My dismal sister </s>
<s> Couldst thou know The wretched home thou keepest </s>
<s> Thy brother, drowned in daily woe, Is thankful when thou sleepest; For if I laugh, however low, When thou'rt awake, thou weepest </s>
<s> I took my sister t'other day (Excuse the slang expression) To Sadler's Wells to see the play In hopes the new impression Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay Effect some slight digression </s>
<s> I asked three gay young dogs from town To join us in our folly, Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown My sister's melancholy: The lively Jones, the sportive Brown, And Robinson the jolly </s>
<s> The maid announced the meal in tones That I myself had taught her, Meant to allay my sister's moans Like oil on troubled water: I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones, And begged him to escort her </s>
<s> Vainly he strove, with ready wit, To joke about the weather - To ventilate the last 'ON DIT' - To quote the price of leather - She groaned "Here I and Sorrow sit: Let us lament together" </s>
<s> I urged "You're wasting time, you know: Delay will spoil the venison" </s>
<s> "My heart is wasted with my woe </s>
<s> There is no rest--in Venice, on The Bridge of Sighs" </s>
<s> she quoted low From Byron and from Tennyson </s>
<s> I need not tell of soup and fish In solemn silence swallowed, The sobs that ushered in each dish, And its departure followed, Nor yet my suicidal wish To BE the cheese I hollowed </s>
<s> Some desperate attempts were made To start a conversation; "Madam," the sportive Brown essayed, "Which kind of recreation, Hunting or fishing, have you made Your special occupation" </s>
<s> Her lips curved downwards instantly, As if of india-rubber </s>
<s> "Hounds IN FULL CRY I like," said she: (Oh how I longed to snub her!) "Of fish, a whale's the one for me, IT IS SO FULL OF BLUBBER" </s>
<s> The night's performance was "King John" </s>
<s> "It's dull," she wept, "and so-so" </s>
<s> Awhile I let her tears flow on, She said they soothed her woe so </s>
<s> At length the curtain rose upon 'Bombastes Furioso' </s>
<s> In vain we roared; in vain we tried To rouse her into laughter: Her pensive glances wandered wide From orchestra to rafter - "TIER UPON TIER" </s>
<s> she said, and sighed; And silence followed after </s>
<s> A VALENTINE [Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see him when he came, but didn't seem to miss him if he stayed away.] And cannot pleasures, while they last, Be actual unless, when past, They leave us shuddering and aghast, With anguish smarting </s>
<s> And cannot friends be firm and fast, And yet bear parting </s>
<s> And must I then, at Friendship's call, Calmly resign the little all (Trifling, I grant, it is and small) I have of gladness, And lend my being to the thrall Of gloom and sadness </s>

<s> THE THREE VOICES The First Voice He trilled a carol fresh and free, He laughed aloud for very glee: There came a breeze from off the sea: It passed athwart the glooming flat - It fanned his forehead as he sat - It lightly bore away his hat, All to the feet of one who stood Like maid enchanted in a wood, Frowning as darkly as she could </s>
<s> With huge umbrella, lank and brown, Unerringly she pinned it down, Right through the centre of the crown </s>
<s> Then, with an aspect cold and grim, Regardless of its battered rim, She took it up and gave it him </s>
<s> A while like one in dreams he stood, Then faltered forth his gratitude In words just short of being rude: For it had lost its shape and shine, And it had cost him four-and-nine, And he was going out to dine </s>
<s> "To dine" </s>
<s> she sneered in acid tone </s>
<s> "To bend thy being to a bone Clothed in a radiance not its own" </s>
<s> The tear-drop trickled to his chin: There was a meaning in her grin That made him feel on fire within </s>
<s> "Term it not 'radiance,'" said he: "'Tis solid nutriment to me </s>
<s> Dinner is Dinner: Tea is Tea" </s>
<s> And she "Yea so </s>
<s> Yet wherefore cease </s>
<s> Let thy scant knowledge find increase </s>
<s> Say 'Men are Men, and Geese are Geese'." He moaned: he knew not what to say </s>
<s> The thought "That I could get away" </s>
<s> Strove with the thought "But I must stay </s>
<s> "To dine" </s>
<s> she shrieked in dragon-wrath </s>
<s> "To swallow wines all foam and froth </s>
<s> To simper at a table-cloth </s>
<s> "Say, can thy noble spirit stoop To join the gormandising troup Who find a solace in the soup </s>
<s> "Canst thou desire or pie or puff </s>
<s> Thy well-bred manners were enough, Without such gross material stuff" </s>
<s> "Yet well-bred men," he faintly said, "Are not willing to be fed: Nor are they well without the bread" </s>
<s> Her visage scorched him ere she spoke: "There are," she said, "a kind of folk Who have no horror of a joke </s>
<s> "Such wretches live: they take their share Of common earth and common air: We come across them here and there: "We grant them--there is no escape - A sort of semi-human shape Suggestive of the man-like Ape" </s>
<s> "In all such theories," said he, "One fixed exception there must be </s>
<s> That is, the Present Company" </s>
<s> Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark: He, aiming blindly in the dark, With random shaft had pierced the mark </s>
<s> She felt that her defeat was plain, Yet madly strove with might and main To get the upper hand again </s>
<s> Fixing her eyes upon the beach, As though unconscious of his speech, She said "Each gives to more than each" </s>
<s> He could not answer yea or nay: He faltered "Gifts may pass away" </s>
<s> Yet knew not what he meant to say </s>
<s> "If that be so," she straight replied, "Each heart with each doth coincide </s>
<s> What boots it </s>
<s> For the world is wide" </s>
<s> "The world is but a Thought," said he: "The vast unfathomable sea Is but a Notion--unto me" </s>
<s> And darkly fell her answer dread Upon his unresisting head, Like half a hundredweight of lead </s>
<s> "The Good and Great must ever shun That reckless and abandoned one Who stoops to perpetrate a pun </s>
<s> "The man that smokes--that reads the Times - That goes to Christmas Pantomimes - Is capable of ANY crimes" </s>
<s> He felt it was his turn to speak, And, with a shamed and crimson cheek, Moaned "This is harder than Bezique" </s>
<s> But when she asked him "Wherefore so" </s>
<s> He felt his very whiskers glow, And frankly owned "I do not know" </s>
<s> While, like broad waves of golden grain, Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane, His colour came and went again </s>
<s> Pitying his obvious distress, Yet with a tinge of bitterness, She said "The More exceeds the Less" </s>
<s> "A truth of such undoubted weight," He urged, "and so extreme in date, It were superfluous to state" </s>
<s> Roused into sudden passion, she In tone of cold malignity: "To others, yea: but not to thee" </s>
<s> But when she saw him quail and quake, And when he urged "For pity's sake" </s>
<s> Once more in gentle tones she spake </s>
<s> "Thought in the mind doth still abide That is by Intellect supplied, And within that Idea doth hide: "And he, that yearns the truth to know, Still further inwardly may go, And find Idea from Notion flow: "And thus the chain, that sages sought, Is to a glorious circle wrought, For Notion hath its source in Thought" </s>
<s> So passed they on with even pace: Yet gradually one might trace A shadow growing on his face </s>
<s> The Second Voice They walked beside the wave-worn beach; Her tongue was very apt to teach, And now and then he did beseech She would abate her dulcet tone, Because the talk was all her own, And he was dull as any drone </s>

<s> Her voice was very full and rich, And, when at length she asked him "Which" </s>

<s> He a bewildered answer gave, Drowned in the sullen moaning wave, Lost in the echoes of the cave </s>
<s> He answered her he knew not what: Like shaft from bow at random shot, He spoke, but she regarded not </s>
<s> She waited not for his reply, But with a downward leaden eye Went on as if he were not by Sound argument and grave defence, Strange questions raised on "Why" </s>
<s> and "Whence" </s>
<s> And wildly tangled evidence </s>
<s> When he, with racked and whirling brain, Feebly implored her to explain, She simply said it all again </s>
<s> Wrenched with an agony intense, He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense, And careless of all consequence: "Mind--I believe--is Essence--Ent - Abstract--that is--an Accident - Which we--that is to say--I meant--" When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed, At length his speech was somewhat hushed, She looked at him, and he was crushed </s>
<s> It needed not her calm reply: She fixed him with a stony eye, And he could neither fight nor fly </s>
<s> While she dissected, word by word, His speech, half guessed at and half heard, As might a cat a little bird </s>
<s> Then, having wholly overthrown His views, and stripped them to the bone, Proceeded to unfold her own </s>
<s> "Shall Man be Man </s>
<s> And shall he miss Of other thoughts no thought but this, Harmonious dews of sober bliss </s>
<s> "What boots it </s>
<s> Shall his fevered eye Through towering nothingness descry The grisly phantom hurry by </s>
<s> "And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air; See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare And redden in the dusky glare </s>

<s> Till, like a silent water-mill, When summer suns have dried the rill, She reached a full stop, and was still </s>
<s> Dead calm succeeded to the fuss, As when the loaded omnibus Has reached the railway terminus: When, for the tumult of the street, Is heard the engine's stifled beat, The velvet tread of porters' feet </s>
<s> With glance that ever sought the ground, She moved her lips without a sound, And every now and then she frowned </s>
<s> He gazed upon the sleeping sea, And joyed in its tranquillity, And in that silence dead, but she To muse a little space did seem, Then, like the echo of a dream, Harked back upon her threadbare theme </s>
<s> Still an attentive ear he lent But could not fathom what she meant: She was not deep, nor eloquent </s>
<s> He marked the ripple on the sand: The even swaying of her hand Was all that he could understand </s>
<s> He saw in dreams a drawing-room, Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom, Waiting--he thought he knew for whom: He saw them drooping here and there, Each feebly huddled on a chair, In attitudes of blank despair: Oysters were not more mute than they, For all their brains were pumped away, And they had nothing more to say - Save one, who groaned "Three hours are gone" </s>
<s> Who shrieked "We'll wait no longer, John </s>
<s> Tell them to set the dinner on" </s>
<s> The vision passed: the ghosts were fled: He saw once more that woman dread: He heard once more the words she said </s>
<s> He left her, and he turned aside: He sat and watched the coming tide Across the shores so newly dried </s>
<s> He wondered at the waters clear, The breeze that whispered in his ear, The billows heaving far and near, And why he had so long preferred To hang upon her every word: "In truth," he said, "it was absurd" </s>
<s> The Third Voice Not long this transport held its place: Within a little moment's space Quick tears were raining down his face His heart stood still, aghast with fear; A wordless voice, nor far nor near, He seemed to hear and not to hear </s>
<s> "Tears kindle not the doubtful spark </s>
<s> If so, why not </s>
<s> Of this remark The bearings are profoundly dark" </s>
<s> "Her speech," he said, "hath caused this pain </s>
<s> Easier I count it to explain The jargon of the howling main, "Or, stretched beside some babbling brook, To con, with inexpressive look, An unintelligible book" </s>
<s> Low spake the voice within his head, In words imagined more than said, Soundless as ghost's intended tread: "If thou art duller than before, Why quittedst thou the voice of lore </s>
<s> Why not endure, expecting more" </s>
<s> "Rather than that," he groaned aghast, "I'd writhe in depths of cavern vast, Some loathly vampire's rich repast" </s>
<s> "'Twere hard," it answered, "themes immense To coop within the narrow fence That rings THY scant intelligence" </s>
<s> "Not so," he urged, "nor once alone: But there was something in her tone That chilled me to the very bone </s>
<s> "Her style was anything but clear, And most unpleasantly severe; Her epithets were very queer </s>
<s> "And yet, so grand were her replies, I could not choose but deem her wise; I did not dare to criticise; "Nor did I leave her, till she went So deep in tangled argument That all my powers of thought were spent" </s>
<s> A little whisper inly slid, "Yet truth is truth: you know you did" </s>
<s> A little wink beneath the lid </s>
<s> And, sickened with excess of dread, Prone to the dust he bent his head, And lay like one three-quarters dead The whisper left him--like a breeze Lost in the depths of leafy trees - Left him by no means at his ease </s>
<s> Once more he weltered in despair, With hands, through denser-matted hair, More tightly clenched than then they were </s>
<s> When, bathed in Dawn of living red, Majestic frowned the mountain head, "Tell me my fault," was all he said </s>
<s> When, at high Noon, the blazing sky Scorched in his head each haggard eye, Then keenest rose his weary cry </s>
<s> And when at Eve the unpitying sun Smiled grimly on the solemn fun, "Alack," he sighed, "what HAVE I done" </s>
<s> But saddest, darkest was the sight, When the cold grasp of leaden Night Dashed him to earth, and held him tight </s>
<s> Tortured, unaided, and alone, Thunders were silence to his groan, Bagpipes sweet music to its tone: "What </s>

<s> The whisper to his ear did seem Like echoed flow of silent stream, Or shadow of forgotten dream, The whisper trembling in the wind: "Her fate with thine was intertwined," So spake it in his inner mind: "Each orbed on each a baleful star: Each proved the other's blight and bar: Each unto each were best, most far: "Yea, each to each was worse than foe: Thou, a scared dullard, gibbering low, AND SHE, AN AVALANCHE OF WOE" </s>

<s> 'Tis for YOU that she whimpers" </s>
<s> And I noted with joy Those sensational simpers: And I said "This is scrumptious"!--a phrase I had learned from the Devonshire shrimpers </s>

<s> FOUR RIDDLES [These consist of two Double Acrostics and two Charades </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> was written at the request of some young friends, who had gone to a ball at an Oxford Commemoration--and also as a specimen of what might be done by making the Double Acrostic A CONNECTED POEM instead of what it has hitherto been, a string of disjointed stanzas, on every conceivable subject, and about as interesting to read straight through as a page of a Cyclopaedia </s>
<s> The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each subsequent stanza one of the cross "lights" </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> II </s>
<s> was written after seeing Miss Ellen Terry perform in the play of "Hamlet" </s>
<s> In this case the first stanza describes the two main words </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> III </s>
<s> was written after seeing Miss Marion Terry perform in Mr Gilbert's play of "Pygmalion and Galatea" </s>
<s> The three stanzas respectively describe "My First," "My Second," and "My Whole".] I There was an ancient City, stricken down With a strange frenzy, and for many a day They paced from morn to eve the crowded town, And danced the night away </s>
<s> I asked the cause: the aged man grew sad: They pointed to a building gray and tall, And hoarsely answered "Step inside, my lad, And then you'll see it all" </s>
<s> * * * * Yet what are all such gaieties to me Whose thoughts are full of indices and surds </s>
<s> x*x + 7x + 53 = 11/3 But something whispered "It will soon be done: Bands cannot always play, nor ladies smile: Endure with patience the distasteful fun For just a little while" </s>
<s> A change came o'er my Vision--it was night: We clove a pathway through a frantic throng: The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright: The chariots whirled along </s>
<s> Within a marble hall a river ran - A living tide, half muslin and half cloth: And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan, Yet swallowed down her wrath; And here one offered to a thirsty fair (His words half-drowned amid those thunders tuneful) Some frozen viand (there were many there), A tooth-ache in each spoonful </s>
<s> There comes a happy pause, for human strength Will not endure to dance without cessation; And every one must reach the point at length Of absolute prostration </s>
<s> At such a moment ladies learn to give, To partners who would urge them over-much, A flat and yet decided negative - Photographers love such </s>
<s> There comes a welcome summons--hope revives, And fading eyes grow bright, and pulses quicken: Incessant pop the corks, and busy knives Dispense the tongue and chicken </s>
<s> Flushed with new life, the crowd flows back again: And all is tangled talk and mazy motion - Much like a waving field of golden grain, Or a tempestuous ocean </s>
<s> And thus they give the time, that Nature meant For peaceful sleep and meditative snores, To ceaseless din and mindless merriment And waste of shoes and floors </s>
<s> And One (we name him not) that flies the flowers, That dreads the dances, and that shuns the salads, They doom to pass in solitude the hours, Writing acrostic-ballads </s>
<s> How late it grows </s>
<s> The hour is surely past That should have warned us with its double knock </s>
<s> The twilight wanes, and morning comes at last - "Oh, Uncle, what's o'clock" </s>
<s> The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks </s>
<s> It MAY mean much, but how is one to know </s>
<s> He opens his mouth--yet out of it, methinks, No words of wisdom flow </s>
<s> II Empress of Art, for thee I twine This wreath with all too slender skill </s>
<s> Forgive my Muse each halting line, And for the deed accept the will </s>
<s> * * * * O day of tears </s>
<s> Whence comes this spectre grim, Parting, like Death's cold river, souls that love </s>
<s> Is not he bound to thee, as thou to him, By vows, unwhispered here, yet heard above </s>
<s> And still it lives, that keen and heavenward flame, Lives in his eye, and trembles in his tone: And these wild words of fury but proclaim A heart that beats for thee, for thee alone </s>
<s> But all is lost: that mighty mind o'erthrown, Like sweet bells jangled, piteous sight to see </s>
<s> "Doubt that the stars are fire," so runs his moan, "Doubt Truth herself, but not my love for thee" </s>
<s> A sadder vision yet: thine aged sire Shaming his hoary locks with treacherous wile </s>
<s> And dost thou now doubt Truth to be a liar </s>
<s> And wilt thou die, that hast forgot to smile </s>
<s> Nay, get thee hence </s>
<s> Leave all thy winsome ways And the faint fragrance of thy scattered flowers: In holy silence wait the appointed days, And weep away the leaden-footed hours </s>
<s> III </s>
<s> The air is bright with hues of light And rich with laughter and with singing: Young hearts beat high in ecstasy, And banners wave, and bells are ringing: But silence falls with fading day, And there's an end to mirth and play </s>
<s> Ah, well-a-day Rest your old bones, ye wrinkled crones </s>
<s> The kettle sings, the firelight dances </s>
<s> Deep be it quaffed, the magic draught That fills the soul with golden fancies </s>
<s> For Youth and Pleasance will not stay, And ye are withered, worn, and gray </s>
<s> Ah, well-a-day </s>
<s> O fair cold face </s>
<s> O form of grace, For human passion madly yearning </s>
<s> O weary air of dumb despair, From marble won, to marble turning </s>
<s> "Leave us not thus" </s>

<s> Ah, well-a-day </s>
<s> IV </s>
<s> My First is singular at best: More plural is my Second: My Third is far the pluralest - So plural-plural, I protest It scarcely can be reckoned </s>
<s> My First is followed by a bird: My Second by believers In magic art: my simple Third Follows, too often, hopes absurd And plausible deceivers </s>
<s> My First to get at wisdom tries - A failure melancholy </s>
<s> My Second men revered as wise: My Third from heights of wisdom flies To depths of frantic folly </s>
<s> My First is ageing day by day: My Second's age is ended: My Third enjoys an age, they say, That never seems to fade away, Through centuries extended </s>
<s> My Whole </s>
<s> I need a poet's pen To paint her myriad phases: The monarch, and the slave, of men - A mountain-summit, and a den Of dark and deadly mazes - A flashing light--a fleeting shade - Beginning, end, and middle Of all that human art hath made Or wit devised </s>
<s> Go, seek HER aid, If you would read my riddle </s>
<s> FAME'S PENNY-TRUMPET [Affectionately dedicated to all "original researchers" who pant for "endowment".] Blow, blow your trumpets till they crack, Ye little men of little souls </s>
<s> And bid them huddle at your back - Gold-sucking leeches, shoals on shoals </s>
<s> Fill all the air with hungry wails - "Reward us, ere we think or write </s>
<s> Without your Gold mere Knowledge fails To sate the swinish appetite" </s>
<s> And, where great Plato paced serene, Or Newton paused with wistful eye, Rush to the chace with hoofs unclean And Babel-clamour of the sty Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise: We will not rob them of their due, Nor vex the ghosts of other days By naming them along with you </s>
<s> They sought and found undying fame: They toiled not for reward nor thanks: Their cheeks are hot with honest shame For you, the modern mountebanks </s>
<s> Who preach of Justice--plead with tears That Love and Mercy should abound - While marking with complacent ears The moaning of some tortured hound: Who prate of Wisdom--nay, forbear, Lest Wisdom turn on you in wrath, Trampling, with heel that will not spare, The vermin that beset her path </s>
<s> Go, throng each other's drawing-rooms, Ye idols of a petty clique: Strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes, And make your penny-trumpets squeak </s>
<s> Deck your dull talk with pilfered shreds Of learning from a nobler time, And oil each other's little heads With mutual Flattery's golden slime: And when the topmost height ye gain, And stand in Glory's ether clear, And grasp the prize of all your pain - So many hundred pounds a year - Then let Fame's banner be unfurled </s>
<s> Sing Paeans for a victory won </s>
<s> Ye tapers, that would light the world, And cast a shadow on the Sun - Who still shall pour His rays sublime, One crystal flood, from East to West, When YE have burned your little time And feebly flickered into rest </s>
