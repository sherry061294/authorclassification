<s> LETTER the FIRST From ISABEL to LAURA How often, in answer to my repeated intreaties that you would give my Daughter a regular detail of the Misfortunes and Adventures of your Life, have you said "No, my freind never will I comply with your request till I may be no longer in Danger of again experiencing such dreadful ones" </s>

<s> Isabel LETTER 2nd LAURA to ISABEL Altho' I cannot agree with you in supposing that I shall never again be exposed to Misfortunes as unmerited as those I have already experienced, yet to avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or ill-nature, I will gratify the curiosity of your daughter; and may the fortitude with which I have suffered the many afflictions of my past Life, prove to her a useful lesson for the support of those which may befall her in her own </s>

<s> When in the Convent, my progress had always exceeded my instructions, my Acquirements had been wonderfull for my age, and I had shortly surpassed my Masters </s>
<s> In my Mind, every Virtue that could adorn it was centered; it was the Rendez-vous of every good Quality and of every noble sentiment </s>

<s> "Yes (exclaimed I) I cannot help thinking it must be somebody who knocks for admittance" </s>
<s> "That is another point (replied he;) We must not pretend to determine on what motive the person may knock--tho' that someone DOES rap at the door, I am partly convinced" </s>

<s> "I'm glad of it (cried my Father) for I long to know who it is" </s>

<s> LETTER 6th LAURA to MARIANNE The noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay--for particular reasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot </s>
<s> He told us that he was the son of an English Baronet, that his Mother had been for many years no more and that he had a Sister of the middle size </s>

<s> Adeiu Laura LETTER 7th LAURA to MARIANNE We remained but a few days after our Marriage, in the Vale of Uske </s>
<s> After taking an affecting Farewell of my Father, my Mother and my Isabel, I accompanied Edward to his Aunt's in Middlesex </s>
<s> Philippa received us both with every expression of affectionate Love </s>
<s> My arrival was indeed a most agreable surprise to her as she had not only been totally ignorant of my Marriage with her Nephew, but had never even had the slightest idea of there being such a person in the World </s>

<s> I found her exactly what her Brother had described her to be--of the middle size </s>
<s> She received me with equal surprise though not with equal Cordiality, as Philippa </s>
<s> There was a disagreable coldness and Forbidding Reserve in her reception of me which was equally distressing and Unexpected </s>
<s> None of that interesting Sensibility or amiable simpathy in her manners and Address to me when we first met which should have distinguished our introduction to each other </s>
<s> Her Language was neither warm, nor affectionate, her expressions of regard were neither animated nor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive me to her Heart, tho' my own were extended to press her to mine </s>
<s> A short Conversation between Augusta and her Brother, which I accidentally overheard encreased my dislike to her, and convinced me that her Heart was no more formed for the soft ties of Love than for the endearing intercourse of Freindship </s>
<s> "But do you think that my Father will ever be reconciled to this imprudent connection" </s>
<s> (said Augusta.) "Augusta (replied the noble Youth) I thought you had a better opinion of me, than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as to consider my Father's Concurrence in any of my affairs, either of Consequence or concern to me </s>
<s> Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you ever know me consult his inclinations or follow his Advice in the least trifling Particular since the age of fifteen" </s>
<s> "Edward (replied she) you are surely too diffident in your own praise </s>
<s> Since you were fifteen only </s>
<s> My Dear Brother since you were five years old, I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the satisfaction of your Father </s>
<s> But still I am not without apprehensions of your being shortly obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by seeking a support for your wife in the Generosity of Sir Edward" </s>
<s> "Never, never Augusta will I so demean myself </s>
<s> (said Edward) </s>
<s> Support </s>
<s> What support will Laura want which she can receive from him" </s>
<s> "Only those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink" </s>
<s> (answered she.) "Victuals and Drink </s>
<s> (replied my Husband in a most nobly contemptuous Manner) and dost thou then imagine that there is no other support for an exalted mind (such as is my Laura's) than the mean and indelicate employment of Eating and Drinking" </s>
<s> "None that I know of, so efficacious" </s>
<s> (returned Augusta) </s>
<s> "And did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love, Augusta </s>
<s> (replied my Edward) </s>
<s> Does it appear impossible to your vile and corrupted Palate, to exist on Love </s>
<s> Can you not conceive the Luxury of living in every distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of your tenderest affection" </s>
<s> "You are too ridiculous (said Augusta) to argue with; perhaps however you may in time be convinced that.." </s>
<s> Here I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech, by the appearance of a very Handsome young Woman, who was ushured into the Room at the Door of which I had been listening </s>
<s> On hearing her announced by the Name of "Lady Dorothea," I instantly quitted my Post and followed her into the Parlour, for I well remembered that she was the Lady, proposed as a Wife for my Edward by the Cruel and Unrelenting Baronet </s>
<s> Altho' Lady Dorothea's visit was nominally to Philippa and Augusta, yet I have some reason to imagine that (acquainted with the Marriage and arrival of Edward) to see me was a principal motive to it </s>
<s> I soon perceived that tho' Lovely and Elegant in her Person and tho' Easy and Polite in her Address, she was of that inferior order of Beings with regard to Delicate Feeling, tender Sentiments, and refined Sensibility, of which Augusta was one </s>
<s> She staid but half an hour and neither in the Course of her Visit, confided to me any of her secret thoughts, nor requested me to confide in her, any of Mine </s>
<s> You will easily imagine therefore my Dear Marianne that I could not feel any ardent affection or very sincere Attachment for Lady Dorothea </s>
<s> Adeiu Laura </s>
<s> LETTER 8th LAURA to MARIANNE, in continuation Lady Dorothea had not left us long before another visitor as unexpected a one as her Ladyship, was announced </s>
<s> It was Sir Edward, who informed by Augusta of her Brother's marriage, came doubtless to reproach him for having dared to unite himself to me without his Knowledge </s>
<s> But Edward foreseeing his design, approached him with heroic fortitude as soon as he entered the Room, and addressed him in the following Manner </s>
<s> "Sir Edward, I know the motive of your Journey here--You come with the base Design of reproaching me for having entered into an indissoluble engagement with my Laura without your Consent </s>
<s> But Sir, I glory in the Act-- </s>
<s> It is my greatest boast that I have incurred the displeasure of my Father" </s>
<s> So saying, he took my hand and whilst Sir Edward, Philippa, and Augusta were doubtless reflecting with admiration on his undaunted Bravery, led me from the Parlour to his Father's Carriage which yet remained at the Door and in which we were instantly conveyed from the pursuit of Sir Edward </s>
<s> The Postilions had at first received orders only to take the London road; as soon as we had sufficiently reflected However, we ordered them to Drive to M---- </s>

<s> At M---- </s>
<s> we arrived in a few hours; and on sending in our names were immediately admitted to Sophia, the Wife of Edward's freind </s>
<s> After having been deprived during the course of 3 weeks of a real freind (for such I term your Mother) imagine my transports at beholding one, most truly worthy of the Name </s>
<s> Sophia was rather above the middle size; most elegantly formed </s>
<s> A soft languor spread over her lovely features, but increased their Beauty-- </s>
<s> It was the Charectarestic of her Mind-- </s>
<s> She was all sensibility and Feeling </s>
<s> We flew into each others arms and after having exchanged vows of mutual Freindship for the rest of our Lives, instantly unfolded to each other the most inward secrets of our Hearts-- </s>
<s> We were interrupted in the delightfull Employment by the entrance of Augustus, (Edward's freind) who was just returned from a solitary ramble </s>
<s> Never did I see such an affecting Scene as was the meeting of Edward and Augustus </s>
<s> "My Life </s>
<s> my Soul" </s>
<s> (exclaimed the former) "My adorable angel" </s>

<s> Adeiu Laura </s>
<s> LETTER the 9th From the same to the same Towards the close of the day we received the following Letter from Philippa </s>
<s> "Sir Edward is greatly incensed by your abrupt departure; he has taken back Augusta to Bedfordshire </s>
<s> Much as I wish to enjoy again your charming society, I cannot determine to snatch you from that, of such dear and deserving Freinds--When your Visit to them is terminated, I trust you will return to the arms of your" "Philippa" </s>
<s> We returned a suitable answer to this affectionate Note and after thanking her for her kind invitation assured her that we would certainly avail ourselves of it, whenever we might have no other place to go to </s>
<s> Tho' certainly nothing could to any reasonable Being, have appeared more satisfactory, than so gratefull a reply to her invitation, yet I know not how it was, but she was certainly capricious enough to be displeased with our behaviour and in a few weeks after, either to revenge our Conduct, or releive her own solitude, married a young and illiterate Fortune-hunter </s>
<s> This imprudent step (tho' we were sensible that it would probably deprive us of that fortune which Philippa had ever taught us to expect) could not on our own accounts, excite from our exalted minds a single sigh; yet fearfull lest it might prove a source of endless misery to the deluded Bride, our trembling Sensibility was greatly affected when we were first informed of the Event </s>
<s> The affectionate Entreaties of Augustus and Sophia that we would for ever consider their House as our Home, easily prevailed on us to determine never more to leave them, In the society of my Edward and this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest moments of my Life; Our time was most delightfully spent, in mutual Protestations of Freindship, and in vows of unalterable Love, in which we were secure from being interrupted, by intruding and disagreable Visitors, as Augustus and Sophia had on their first Entrance in the Neighbourhood, taken due care to inform the surrounding Families, that as their happiness centered wholly in themselves, they wished for no other society </s>
<s> But alas </s>
<s> my Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then enjoyed was too perfect to be lasting </s>
<s> A most severe and unexpected Blow at once destroyed every sensation of Pleasure </s>
<s> Convinced as you must be from what I have already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that there never were a happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that their union had been contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel and Mercenery Parents; who had vainly endeavoured with obstinate Perseverance to force them into a Marriage with those whom they had ever abhorred; but with a Heroic Fortitude worthy to be related and admired, they had both, constantly refused to submit to such despotic Power </s>
<s> After having so nobly disentangled themselves from the shackles of Parental Authority, by a Clandestine Marriage, they were determined never to forfeit the good opinion they had gained in the World, in so doing, by accepting any proposals of reconciliation that might be offered them by their Fathers--to this farther tryal of their noble independance however they never were exposed </s>
<s> They had been married but a few months when our visit to them commenced during which time they had been amply supported by a considerable sum of money which Augustus had gracefully purloined from his unworthy father's Escritoire, a few days before his union with Sophia </s>
<s> By our arrival their Expenses were considerably encreased tho' their means for supplying them were then nearly exhausted </s>
<s> But they, Exalted Creatures </s>
<s> scorned to reflect a moment on their pecuniary Distresses and would have blushed at the idea of paying their Debts.--Alas </s>
<s> what was their Reward for such disinterested Behaviour </s>
<s> The beautifull Augustus was arrested and we were all undone </s>
<s> Such perfidious Treachery in the merciless perpetrators of the Deed will shock your gentle nature Dearest Marianne as much as it then affected the Delicate sensibility of Edward, Sophia, your Laura, and of Augustus himself </s>

<s> We promised that we would, and he set forwards on his journey to Town </s>
<s> During his absence we faithfully complied with his Desire and after the most mature Deliberation, at length agreed that the best thing we could do was to leave the House; of which we every moment expected the officers of Justice to take possession </s>
<s> We waited therefore with the greatest impatience, for the return of Edward in order to impart to him the result of our Deliberations </s>
<s> But no Edward appeared </s>
<s> In vain did we count the tedious moments of his absence--in vain did we weep--in vain even did we sigh--no Edward returned-- </s>
<s> This was too cruel, too unexpected a Blow to our Gentle Sensibility--we could not support it--we could only faint </s>
<s> At length collecting all the Resolution I was Mistress of, I arose and after packing up some necessary apparel for Sophia and myself, I dragged her to a Carriage I had ordered and we instantly set out for London </s>
<s> As the Habitation of Augustus was within twelve miles of Town, it was not long e'er we arrived there, and no sooner had we entered Holboun than letting down one of the Front Glasses I enquired of every decent-looking Person that we passed "If they had seen my Edward" </s>
<s> But as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated Enquiries, I gained little, or indeed, no information concerning him </s>

<s> "To Newgate Gentle Youth (replied I), to see Augustus" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> no, no, (exclaimed Sophia) I cannot go to Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus in so cruel a confinement--my feelings are sufficiently shocked by the RECITAL, of his Distress, but to behold it will overpower my Sensibility" </s>
<s> As I perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her Sentiments the Postilion was instantly directed to return into the Country </s>
<s> You may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my Dearest Marianne, that in the Distress I then endured, destitute of any support, and unprovided with any Habitation, I should never once have remembered my Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of Uske </s>
<s> To account for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a trifling circumstance concerning them which I have as yet never mentioned </s>

<s> He was Sophia's cousin </s>
<s> The haste with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt of our Note, spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to pronounce him at first sight, a tender and simpathetic Freind </s>

<s> Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally well disposed, endowed with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic Disposition, she might, had these amiable qualities been properly encouraged, have been an ornament to human Nature; but unfortunately her Father possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted to admire so promising a Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his power to prevent it encreasing with her Years </s>
<s> He had actually so far extinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail on her to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation </s>
<s> They were to be married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when we arrived </s>
<s> WE soon saw through his character </s>
<s> He was just such a Man as one might have expected to be the choice of Macdonald </s>
<s> They said he was Sensible, well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge of such trifles, but as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had never read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least resemblance to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could feel no affection for him, or at least that she ought to feel none </s>
<s> The very circumstance of his being her father's choice too, was so much in his disfavour, that had he been deserving her, in every other respect yet THAT of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the Eyes of Janetta for rejecting him </s>
<s> These considerations we were determined to represent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting with the desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors in the affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her own opinion, and a suitable contempt of her father's </s>
<s> We found her indeed all that our warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no difficulty to convince her that it was impossible she could love Graham, or that it was her Duty to disobey her Father; the only thing at which she rather seemed to hesitate was our assertion that she must be attached to some other Person </s>

<s> "Never (replied she) that I remember--he has always left the room indeed when his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly abruptly or without making a bow" </s>

<s> Consider but for a moment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose that he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person" </s>
<s> Having settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into consideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform M'Kenrie of the favourable Opinion Janetta entertained of him... </s>
<s> We at length agreed to acquaint him with it by an anonymous Letter which Sophia drew up in the following manner </s>

<s> The amiable M'Kenrie, whose modesty as he afterwards assured us had been the only reason of his having so long concealed the violence of his affection for Janetta, on receiving this Billet flew on the wings of Love to Macdonald-Hall, and so powerfully pleaded his Attachment to her who inspired it, that after a few more private interveiws, Sophia and I experienced the satisfaction of seeing them depart for Gretna-Green, which they chose for the celebration of their Nuptials, in preference to any other place although it was at a considerable distance from Macdonald-Hall </s>

<s> LETTER the 13th LAURA in continuation They had been gone nearly a couple of Hours, before either Macdonald or Graham had entertained any suspicion of the affair </s>
<s> And they might not even then have suspected it, but for the following little Accident </s>
<s> Sophia happening one day to open a private Drawer in Macdonald's Library with one of her own keys, discovered that it was the Place where he kept his Papers of consequence and amongst them some bank notes of considerable amount </s>
<s> This discovery she imparted to me; and having agreed together that it would be a proper treatment of so vile a Wretch as Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly gained, it was determined that the next time we should either of us happen to go that way, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from the drawer </s>
<s> This well meant Plan we had often successfully put in Execution; but alas </s>
<s> on the very day of Janetta's Escape, as Sophia was majestically removing the 5th Bank-note from the Drawer to her own purse, she was suddenly most impertinently interrupted in her employment by the entrance of Macdonald himself, in a most abrupt and precipitate Manner </s>
<s> Sophia (who though naturally all winning sweetness could when occasions demanded it call forth the Dignity of her sex) instantly put on a most forbidding look, and darting an angry frown on the undaunted culprit, demanded in a haughty tone of voice "Wherefore her retirement was thus insolently broken in on" </s>
<s> The unblushing Macdonald, without even endeavouring to exculpate himself from the crime he was charged with, meanly endeavoured to reproach Sophia with ignobly defrauding him of his money.. </s>
<s> The dignity of Sophia was wounded; "Wretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing the Bank-note in the Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act, of which the bare idea makes me blush" </s>
<s> The base wretch was still unconvinced and continued to upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such opprobious Language, that at length he so greatly provoked the gentle sweetness of her Nature, as to induce her to revenge herself on him by informing him of Janetta's Elopement, and of the active Part we had both taken in the affair </s>
<s> At this period of their Quarrel I entered the Library and was as you may imagine equally offended as Sophia at the ill-grounded accusations of the malevolent and contemptible Macdonald </s>

<s> From this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly apropos; it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman's Phaeton, on the road which ran murmuring behind us </s>

<s> It was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish the Number of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they were many </s>

<s> As soon as she had complyed with my wishes in this particular and had given me an accurate detail of every thing that had befallen her since our separation (the particulars of which if you are not already acquainted with, your Mother will give you) I applied to Augusta for the same information respecting herself, Sir Edward and Lady Dorothea </s>
<s> She told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of Nature, her curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in that part of the World had been so much raised by Gilpin's Tour to the Highlands, that she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to Scotland and had persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them </s>

<s> My next enquiries were concerning Philippa and her Husband, the latter of whom I learned having spent all her fortune, had recourse for subsistence to the talent in which, he had always most excelled, namely, Driving, and that having sold every thing which belonged to them except their Coach, had converted it into a Stage and in order to be removed from any of his former Acquaintance, had driven it to Edinburgh from whence he went to Sterling every other Day </s>
<s> That Philippa still retaining her affection for her ungratefull Husband, had followed him to Scotland and generally accompanied him in his little Excursions to Sterling </s>
<s> "It has only been to throw a little money into their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my Father has always travelled in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the Country since our arrival in Scotland--for it would certainly have been much more agreable to us, to visit the Highlands in a Postchaise than merely to travel from Edinburgh to Sterling and from Sterling to Edinburgh every other Day in a crowded and uncomfortable Stage" </s>
<s> I perfectly agreed with her in her sentiments on the affair, and secretly blamed Sir Edward for thus sacrificing his Daughter's Pleasure for the sake of a ridiculous old woman whose folly in marrying so young a man ought to be punished </s>

<s> LETTER the SECOND From Miss C </s>
<s> LUTTERELL to Miss M </s>
<s> LESLEY in answer </s>
<s> Glenford Febry 12 I have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking you my dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should not have deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the last five weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements for my sisters wedding, as to allow me no time to devote either to you or myself </s>
<s> And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the Match is broke off, and all my Labour thrown away </s>
<s> Imagine how great the Dissapointment must be to me, when you consider that after having laboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get the Wedding dinner ready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef, Broiled Mutton, and Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the Honey-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been Roasting, Broiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose </s>
<s> Indeed my dear Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to what I experienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in the store-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me that Hervey had been thrown from his Horse, had fractured his Scull and was pronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger </s>
<s> "Good God </s>
<s> (said I) you dont say so </s>
<s> Why what in the name of Heaven will become of all the Victuals </s>
<s> We shall never be able to eat it while it is good </s>
<s> However, we'll call in the Surgeon to help us </s>
<s> I shall be able to manage the Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and You and the Doctor must finish the rest" </s>
<s> Here I was interrupted, by seeing my poor Sister fall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests, where we keep our Table linen </s>
<s> I immediately called my Mother and the Maids, and at last we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she was sensible, she expressed a determination of going instantly to Henry, and was so wildly bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest Difficulty in the World to prevent her putting it in execution; at last however more by Force than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her room; we laid her upon the Bed, and she continued for some Hours in the most dreadful Convulsions </s>
<s> My Mother and I continued in the room with her, and when any intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would allow us, we joined in heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in our provisions which this Event must occasion, and in concerting some plan for getting rid of them </s>
<s> We agreed that the best thing we could do was to begin eating them immediately, and accordingly we ordered up the cold Ham and Fowls, and instantly began our Devouring Plan on them with great Alacrity </s>
<s> We would have persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of a Chicken, but she would not be persuaded </s>
<s> She was however much quieter than she had been; the convulsions she had before suffered having given way to an almost perfect Insensibility </s>
<s> We endeavoured to rouse her by every means in our power, but to no purpose </s>
<s> I talked to her of Henry </s>
<s> "Dear Eloisa (said I) there's no occasion for your crying so much about such a trifle </s>
<s> (for I was willing to make light of it in order to comfort her) I beg you would not mind it--You see it does not vex me in the least; though perhaps I may suffer most from it after all; for I shall not only be obliged to eat up all the Victuals I have dressed already, but must if Henry should recover (which however is not very likely) dress as much for you again; or should he die (as I suppose he will) I shall still have to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry any one else </s>
<s> So you see that tho' perhaps for the present it may afflict you to think of Henry's sufferings, Yet I dare say he'll die soon, and then his pain will be over and you will be easy, whereas my Trouble will last much longer for work as hard as I may, I am certain that the pantry cannot be cleared in less than a fortnight" </s>
<s> Thus I did all in my power to console her, but without any effect, and at last as I saw that she did not seem to listen to me, I said no more, but leaving her with my Mother I took down the remains of The Ham and Chicken, and sent William to ask how Henry did </s>
<s> He was not expected to live many Hours; he died the same day </s>
<s> We took all possible care to break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the tenderest manner; yet in spite of every precaution, her sufferings on hearing it were too violent for her reason, and she continued for many hours in a high Delirium </s>
<s> She is still extremely ill, and her Physicians are greatly afraid of her going into a Decline </s>
<s> We are therefore preparing for Bristol, where we mean to be in the course of the next week </s>
<s> And now my dear Margaret let me talk a little of your affairs; and in the first place I must inform you that it is confidently reported, your Father is going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so unpleasing a report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it </s>
<s> I have written to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning it, which as she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give me </s>
<s> I know not who is the Lady </s>
<s> I think your Brother is extremely right in the resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps contribute to obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events, which have lately so much afflicted him--I am happy to find that tho' secluded from all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or unhappy--that you may never know what it is to, be either is the wish of your sincerely affectionate C.L </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> I have this instant received an answer from my freind Susan, which I enclose to you, and on which you will make your own reflections </s>
<s> The enclosed LETTER My dear CHARLOTTE You could not have applied for information concerning the report of Sir George Lesleys Marriage, to any one better able to give it you than I am </s>
<s> Sir George is certainly married; I was myself present at the Ceremony, which you will not be surprised at when I subscribe myself your Affectionate Susan Lesley LETTER the THIRD From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss C </s>
<s> LUTTERELL Lesley Castle February the 16th I have made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my Dear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were </s>
<s> I reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a second family, our fortunes must be considerably diminushed--that if his Wife should be of an extravagant turn, she would encourage him to persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little encouragement would be necessary, and which has I fear already proved but too detrimental to his health and fortune--that she would now become Mistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother, and which Sir George had always promised us--that if they did not come into Perthshire I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my Mother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit at the head of her Father's table-- </s>
<s> These my dear Charlotte were the melancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing Susan's letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she had perused it likewise </s>
<s> The same ideas, the same fears, immediately occupied her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most, whether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own Consequence </s>
<s> We both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is handsome and what is your opinion of her; as you honour her with the appellation of your freind, we flatter ourselves that she must be amiable </s>
<s> My Brother is already in Paris </s>
<s> He intends to quit it in a few Days, and to begin his route to Italy </s>
<s> He writes in a most chearfull manner, says that the air of France has greatly recovered both his Health and Spirits; that he has now entirely ceased to think of Louisa with any degree either of Pity or Affection, that he even feels himself obliged to her for her Elopement, as he thinks it very good fun to be single again </s>
<s> By this, you may perceive that he has entirely regained that chearful Gaiety, and sprightly Wit, for which he was once so remarkable </s>
<s> When he first became acquainted with Louisa which was little more than three years ago, he was one of the most lively, the most agreable young Men of the age-- </s>
<s> I beleive you never yet heard the particulars of his first acquaintance with her </s>
<s> It commenced at our cousin Colonel Drummond's; at whose house in Cumberland he spent the Christmas, in which he attained the age of two and twenty </s>
<s> Louisa Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of Mrs Drummond, who dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty, left his only Child then about eighteen to the protection of any of his Relations who would protect her </s>
<s> Mrs Drummond was the only one who found herself so disposed--Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable Cottage in Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from every pecuniary Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant Enjoyment that Money could purchase-- </s>
<s> Louisa was naturally ill-tempered and Cunning; but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition, under the appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too well knew, that to be married, would be the only chance she would have of not being starved, and who flattered himself that with such an extroidinary share of personal beauty, joined to a gentleness of Manners, and an engaging address, she might stand a good chance of pleasing some young Man who might afford to marry a girl without a Shilling </s>
<s> Louisa perfectly entered into her father's schemes and was determined to forward them with all her care and attention </s>
<s> By dint of Perseverance and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised her natural disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to impose upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with her discovered her real Character </s>
<s> Such was Louisa when the hapless Lesley first beheld her at Drummond-house </s>
<s> His heart which (to use your favourite comparison) was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a Whipt-syllabub, could not resist her attractions </s>
<s> In a very few Days, he was falling in love, shortly after actually fell, and before he had known her a Month, he had married her </s>
<s> My Father was at first highly displeased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found that they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the match </s>
<s> The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty of his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely sufficient to support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease </s>
<s> For the first twelvemonth, no one could be happier than Lesley, and no one more amiable to appearance than Louisa, and so plausibly did she act and so cautiously behave that tho' Matilda and I often spent several weeks together with them, yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real Disposition </s>
<s> After the birth of Louisa however, which one would have thought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she had so long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then thought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did indeed appear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she seemed to take no pains to prevent that affection from ever diminushing </s>
<s> Our visits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent and by far less agreable than they used to be </s>
<s> Our absence was however never either mentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of young Danvers with whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at one of the Universities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of Matilda and your freind, tho' there certainly never were pleasanter girls than we are </s>
<s> You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial happiness; I will not repeat it-- </s>
<s> Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I have not yet mentioned anything of the matter, I hope you will do me the justice to beleive that I THINK and FEEL, a great deal for your Sisters affliction </s>
<s> I do not doubt but that the healthy air of the Bristol downs will intirely remove it, by erasing from her Mind the remembrance of Henry </s>

<s> LETTER the FOURTH From Miss C </s>
<s> LUTTERELL to Miss M </s>
<s> LESLEY Bristol February 27th My Dear Peggy I have but just received your letter, which being directed to Sussex while I was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here, and from some unaccountable Delay, has but this instant reached me-- </s>
<s> I return you many thanks for the account it contains of Lesley's acquaintance, Love and Marriage with Louisa, which has not the less entertained me for having often been repeated to me before </s>
<s> I have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to imagine our pantry is by this time nearly cleared, as we left Particular orders with the servants to eat as hard as they possibly could, and to call in a couple of Chairwomen to assist them </s>
<s> We brought a cold Pigeon pye, a cold turkey, a cold tongue, and half a dozen Jellies with us, which we were lucky enough with the help of our Landlady, her husband, and their three children, to get rid of, in less than two days after our arrival </s>
<s> Poor Eloisa is still so very indifferent both in Health and Spirits, that I very much fear, the air of the Bristol downs, healthy as it is, has not been able to drive poor Henry from her remembrance </s>
<s> You ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable--I will now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms </s>
<s> She is short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a good deal; has fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let you know as soon as she sees you, and is altogether very pretty </s>
<s> She is remarkably good-tempered when she has her own way, and very lively when she is not out of humour </s>
<s> She is naturally extravagant and not very affected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from me, and never writes anything but her answers to them </s>
<s> She plays, sings and Dances, but has no taste for either, and excells in none, tho' she says she is passionately fond of all </s>
<s> Perhaps you may flatter me so far as to be surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection should be my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our freindship arose rather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine </s>
<s> We spent two or three days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom we both happened to be connected-- </s>
<s> During our visit, the Weather being remarkably bad, and our party particularly stupid, she was so good as to conceive a violent partiality for me, which very soon settled in a downright Freindship and ended in an established correspondence </s>
<s> She is probably by this time as tired of me, as I am of her; but as she is too Polite and I am too civil to say so, our letters are still as frequent and affectionate as ever, and our Attachment as firm and sincere as when it first commenced </s>
<s> As she had a great taste for the pleasures of London, and of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some difficulty in prevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I dare say she feels of beholding you, at the expence of quitting those favourite haunts of Dissipation, for the melancholy tho' venerable gloom of the castle you inhabit </s>
<s> Perhaps however if she finds her health impaired by too much amusement, she may acquire fortitude sufficient to undertake a Journey to Scotland in the hope of its Proving at least beneficial to her health, if not conducive to her happiness </s>
<s> Your fears I am sorry to say, concerning your father's extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers Jewels and your Sister's consequence, I should suppose are but too well founded </s>
<s> My freind herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably spend nearly as much every year in Dress and Public places, if she can get it--she will certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the manner of living to which he has been so long accustomed, and there is therefore some reason to fear that you will be very well off, if you get any fortune at all </s>
<s> The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be hers, and there is too much reason to think that she will preside at her Husbands table in preference to his Daughter </s>
<s> But as so melancholy a subject must necessarily extremely distress you, I will no longer dwell on it-- </s>
<s> Eloisa's indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a season of the year, that we have actually seen but one genteel family since we came </s>
<s> Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill health of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may imagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are of course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost every day, and dined with them yesterday </s>
<s> We spent a very pleasant Day, and had a very good Dinner, tho' to be sure the Veal was terribly underdone, and the Curry had no seasoning </s>
<s> I could not help wishing all dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it-- </s>
<s> A brother of Mrs Marlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking young Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself </s>
<s> I tell Eloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all seem to relish the proposal </s>
<s> I should like to see the girl married and Cleveland has a very good estate </s>
<s> Perhaps you may wonder that I do not consider myself as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but to tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a Wedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner, and therefore while I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me, I shall never think of doing it myself, as I very much suspect that I should not have so much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner, as for dressing that of my freinds </s>

<s> LETTER the FIFTH Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle March 18th On the same day that I received your last kind letter, Matilda received one from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh, and informed us that he should do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us on the following evening </s>
<s> This as you may suppose considerably surprised us, particularly as your account of her Ladyship had given us reason to imagine there was little chance of her visiting Scotland at a time that London must be so gay </s>
<s> As it was our business however to be delighted at such a mark of condescension as a visit from Sir George and Lady Lesley, we prepared to return them an answer expressive of the happiness we enjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing, when luckily recollecting that as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening, it would be impossible for my father to receive it before he left Edinburgh, we contented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we were as happy as we ought to be </s>
<s> At nine in the Evening on the following day, they came, accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers </s>
<s> Her Ladyship perfectly answers the description you sent me of her, except that I do not think her so pretty as you seem to consider her </s>

<s> Her curiosity to see us (which must have been great to bring her more than four hundred miles) being now perfectly gratified, she already begins to mention their return to town, and has desired us to accompany her </s>

<s> LETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle March 20th We arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already heartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square for such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this </s>
<s> You can form no idea sufficiently hideous, of its dungeon-like form </s>
<s> It is actually perched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible, that I expected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented having gratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of being obliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a manner </s>
<s> But as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of this tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having my spirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the Miss Lesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh </s>
<s> But here again, I met with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise </s>
<s> Matilda and Margaret Lesley are two great, tall, out of the way, over-grown, girls, just of a proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison as themselves </s>
<s> I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these Scotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits </s>
<s> They will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to accompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight </s>
<s> Besides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who I beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave me a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss SOMEBODY which I have entirely forgot </s>
<s> I hate scandal and detest Children </s>
<s> I have been plagued ever since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of Scotch wretches, with terrible hard-names; they were so civil, gave me so many invitations, and talked of coming again so soon, that I could not help affronting them </s>
<s> I suppose I shall not see them any more, and yet as a family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do with myself </s>
<s> These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no Drawings but Scotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems--and I hate everything Scotch </s>
<s> In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett with a great deal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there is not a creature in the House whom I have any wish to please </s>
<s> I have just had a conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly offended me, and which as I have nothing more entertaining to send you I will gave you the particulars of </s>
<s> You must know that I have for these 4 or 5 Days past strongly suspected William of entertaining a partiality to my eldest Daughter </s>
<s> I own indeed that had I been inclined to fall in love with any woman, I should not have made choice of Matilda Lesley for the object of my passion; for there is nothing I hate so much as a tall Woman: but however there is no accounting for some men's taste and as William is himself nearly six feet high, it is not wonderful that he should be partial to that height </s>
<s> Now as I have a very great affection for my Brother and should be extremely sorry to see him unhappy, which I suppose he means to be if he cannot marry Matilda, as moreover I know that his circumstances will not allow him to marry any one without a fortune, and that Matilda's is entirely dependant on her Father, who will neither have his own inclination nor my permission to give her anything at present, I thought it would be doing a good-natured action by my Brother to let him know as much, in order that he might choose for himself, whether to conquer his passion, or Love and Despair </s>
<s> Accordingly finding myself this Morning alone with him in one of the horrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause to him in the following Manner </s>
<s> "Well my dear William what do you think of these girls </s>
<s> for my part, I do not find them so plain as I expected: but perhaps you may think me partial to the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right--They are indeed so very like Sir George that it is natural to think"-- "My Dear Susan (cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement) You do not really think they bear the least resemblance to their Father </s>
<s> He is so very plain!--but I beg your pardon--I had entirely forgotten to whom I was speaking--" "Oh </s>
<s> pray dont mind me; (replied I) every one knows Sir George is horribly ugly, and I assure you I always thought him a fright" </s>
<s> "You surprise me extremely (answered William) by what you say both with respect to Sir George and his Daughters </s>
<s> You cannot think your Husband so deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see any resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion perfectly unlike him and perfectly Handsome" </s>
<s> "If that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no proof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and very handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is very plain" </s>
<s> "By no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very unpleasing in a Man" </s>
<s> "But you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be very plain" </s>
<s> "Men are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex" </s>
<s> (said he) </s>
<s> "Neither Men nor Women can think Sir George tolerable" </s>
<s> "Well, well, (said he) we will not dispute about HIS Beauty, but your opinion of his DAUGHTERS is surely very singular, for if I understood you right, you said you did not find them so plain as you expected to do" </s>
<s> "Why, do YOU find them plainer then" </s>
<s> (said I) </s>
<s> "I can scarcely beleive you to be serious (returned he) when you speak of their persons in so extroidinary a Manner </s>
<s> Do not you think the Miss Lesleys are two very handsome young Women" </s>
<s> "Lord </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> (cried I) I think them terribly plain" </s>
<s> "Plain </s>
<s> (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot really think so </s>
<s> Why what single Feature in the face of either of them, can you possibly find fault with" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> trust me for that; (replied I) </s>
<s> Come I will begin with the eldest--with Matilda </s>
<s> Shall I, William" </s>
<s> (I looked as cunning as I could when I said it, in order to shame him) </s>
<s> "They are so much alike (said he) that I should suppose the faults of one, would be the faults of both" </s>
<s> "Well, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall" </s>
<s> "They are TALLER than you are indeed" </s>
<s> (said he with a saucy smile.) "Nay, (said I), I know nothing of that" </s>
<s> "Well, but (he continued) tho' they may be above the common size, their figures are perfectly elegant; and as to their faces, their Eyes are beautifull" </s>
<s> "I never can think such tremendous, knock-me-down figures in the least degree elegant, and as for their eyes, they are so tall that I never could strain my neck enough to look at them" </s>
<s> "Nay, (replied he) I know not whether you may not be in the right in not attempting it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their Lustre" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> Certainly </s>
<s> (said I, with the greatest complacency, for I assure you my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho' by what followed, one would suppose that William was conscious of having given me just cause to be so, for coming up to me and taking my hand, he said) "You must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have offended you" </s>
<s> "Offended me </s>
<s> Dear Brother, how came such a thought in your head </s>
<s> (returned I) No really </s>
<s> I assure you that I am not in the least surprised at your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these girls".-- "Well, but (interrupted William) remember that we have not yet concluded our dispute concerning them </s>
<s> What fault do you find with their complexion" </s>
<s> "They are so horridly pale" </s>
<s> "They have always a little colour, and after any exercise it is considerably heightened" </s>
<s> "Yes, but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of the world, they will never be able raise more than their common stock--except indeed they amuse themselves with running up and Down these horrid old galleries and Antichambers" </s>
<s> "Well, (replied my Brother in a tone of vexation, and glancing an impertinent look at me) if they HAVE but little colour, at least, it is all their own" </s>
<s> This was too much my dear Charlotte, for I am certain that he had the impudence by that look, of pretending to suspect the reality of mine </s>
<s> But you I am sure will vindicate my character whenever you may hear it so cruelly aspersed, for you can witness how often I have protested against wearing Rouge, and how much I always told you I disliked it </s>
<s> And I assure you that my opinions are still the same.-- </s>
<s> Well, not bearing to be so suspected by my Brother, I left the room immediately, and have been ever since in my own Dressing-room writing to you </s>
<s> What a long letter have I made of it </s>
<s> But you must not expect to receive such from me when I get to Town; for it is only at Lesley castle, that one has time to write even to a Charlotte Lutterell.-- </s>
<s> I was so much vexed by William's glance, that I could not summon Patience enough, to stay and give him that advice respecting his attachment to Matilda which had first induced me from pure Love to him to begin the conversation; and I am now so thoroughly convinced by it, of his violent passion for her, that I am certain he would never hear reason on the subject, and I shall there fore give myself no more trouble either about him or his favourite </s>

<s> Do be convinced that you are both perfectly handsome and say no more of the Matter </s>
<s> I suppose this letter must be directed to Portman Square where probably (great as is your affection for Lesley Castle) you will not be sorry to find yourself </s>
<s> In spite of all that people may say about Green fields and the Country I was always of opinion that London and its amusements must be very agreable for a while, and should be very happy could my Mother's income allow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during Winter </s>
<s> I always longed particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether the cold Beef there is cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly suspicion that few people understand the art of cutting a slice of cold Beef so well as I do: nay it would be hard if I did not know something of the Matter, for it was a part of my Education that I took by far the most pains with </s>
<s> Mama always found me HER best scholar, tho' when Papa was alive Eloisa was HIS </s>
<s> Never to be sure were there two more different Dispositions in the World </s>
<s> We both loved Reading </s>
<s> SHE preferred Histories, and I Receipts </s>
<s> She loved drawing, Pictures, and I drawing Pullets </s>
<s> No one could sing a better song than she, and no one make a better Pye than I.--And so it has always continued since we have been no longer children </s>
<s> The only difference is that all disputes on the superior excellence of our Employments THEN so frequent are now no more </s>
<s> We have for many years entered into an agreement always to admire each other's works; I never fail listening to HER Music, and she is as constant in eating my pies </s>
<s> Such at least was the case till Henry Hervey made his appearance in Sussex </s>
<s> Before the arrival of his Aunt in our neighbourhood where she established herself you know about a twelvemonth ago, his visits to her had been at stated times, and of equal and settled Duration; but on her removal to the Hall which is within a walk from our House, they became both more frequent and longer </s>
<s> This as you may suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs Diana who is a professed enemy to everything which is not directed by Decorum and Formality, or which bears the least resemblance to Ease and Good-breeding </s>
<s> Nay so great was her aversion to her Nephews behaviour that I have often heard her give such hints of it before his face that had not Henry at such times been engaged in conversation with Eloisa, they must have caught his Attention and have very much distressed him </s>
<s> The alteration in my Sisters behaviour which I have before hinted at, now took place </s>
<s> The Agreement we had entered into of admiring each others productions she no longer seemed to regard, and tho' I constantly applauded even every Country-dance, she played, yet not even a pidgeon-pye of my making could obtain from her a single word of approbation </s>
<s> This was certainly enough to put any one in a Passion; however, I was as cool as a cream-cheese and having formed my plan and concerted a scheme of Revenge, I was determined to let her have her own way and not even to make her a single reproach </s>
<s> My scheme was to treat her as she treated me, and tho' she might even draw my own Picture or play Malbrook (which is the only tune I ever really liked) not to say so much as "Thank you Eloisa;" tho' I had for many years constantly hollowed whenever she played, BRAVO, BRAVISSIMO, ENCORE, DA CAPO, ALLEGRETTO, CON EXPRESSIONE, and POCO PRESTO with many other such outlandish words, all of them as Eloisa told me expressive of my Admiration; and so indeed I suppose they are, as I see some of them in every Page of every Music book, being the sentiments I imagine of the composer </s>
<s> I executed my Plan with great Punctuality </s>
<s> I can not say success, for alas </s>
<s> my silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease her; on the contrary she actually said to me one day "Well Charlotte, I am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous custom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made my head ake, and yourself hoarse </s>
<s> I feel very much obliged to you for keeping your admiration to yourself" </s>
<s> I never shall forget the very witty answer I made to this speech </s>
<s> "Eloisa (said I) I beg you would be quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future, for be assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own pursuits and never extend it to yours" </s>
<s> This was the only very severe thing I ever said in my Life; not but that I have often felt myself extremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings public </s>
<s> I suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection for each other than Henry and Eloisa; no, the Love of your Brother for Miss Burton could not be so strong tho' it might be more violent </s>
<s> You may imagine therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have him play her such a trick </s>
<s> Poor girl </s>
<s> she still laments his Death with undiminished constancy, notwithstanding he has been dead more than six weeks; but some People mind such things more than others </s>
<s> The ill state of Health into which his loss has thrown her makes her so weak, and so unable to support the least exertion, that she has been in tears all this Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs Marlowe who with her Husband, Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this morning </s>
<s> I am sorry to have them go because they are the only family with whom we have here any acquaintance, but I never thought of crying; to be sure Eloisa and Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me, and have therefore contracted a kind of affection for each other, which does not make Tears so inexcusable in them as they would be in me </s>
<s> The Marlowes are going to Town; Cliveland accompanies them; as neither Eloisa nor I could catch him I hope you or Matilda may have better Luck </s>
<s> I know not when we shall leave Bristol, Eloisa's spirits are so low that she is very averse to moving, and yet is certainly by no means mended by her residence here </s>
<s> A week or two will I hope determine our Measures--in the mean time believe me and etc--and etc--Charlotte Lutterell </s>
<s> LETTER the EIGHTH Miss LUTTERELL to Mrs MARLOWE Bristol April 4th I feel myself greatly obliged to you my dear Emma for such a mark of your affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you made me of our Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great releif to me to write to you and as long as my Health and Spirits will allow me, you will find me a very constant correspondent; I will not say an entertaining one, for you know my situation suffciently not to be ignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and I know my own Heart too well not to be sensible that it would be unnatural </s>
<s> You must not expect news for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted, or in whose proceedings we have any Interest </s>
<s> You must not expect scandal for by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or inventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy effusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness it once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness </s>
<s> The Possibility of being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry will be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I know refuse to read what it will so much releive my Heart to write </s>
<s> I once thought that to have what is in general called a Freind (I mean one of my own sex to whom I might speak with less reserve than to any other person) independant of my sister would never be an object of my wishes, but how much was I mistaken </s>
<s> Charlotte is too much engrossed by two confidential correspondents of that sort, to supply the place of one to me, and I hope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I say that to have some kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to my sorrows without endeavouring to console me was what I had for some time wished for, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which followed it and the particular affectionate attention you paid me almost from the first, caused me to entertain the flattering Idea of those attentions being improved on a closer acquaintance into a Freindship which, if you were what my wishes formed you would be the greatest Happiness I could be capable of enjoying </s>
<s> To find that such Hopes are realised is a satisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is now almost the only one I can ever experience.--I feel myself so languid that I am sure were you with me you would oblige me to leave off writing, and I cannot give you a greater proof of my affection for you than by acting, as I know you would wish me to do, whether Absent or Present </s>

<s> LETTER the NINTH Mrs MARLOWE to Miss LUTTERELL Grosvenor Street, April 10th Need I say my dear Eloisa how wellcome your letter was to me I cannot give a greater proof of the pleasure I received from it, or of the Desire I feel that our Correspondence may be regular and frequent than by setting you so good an example as I now do in answering it before the end of the week-- </s>
<s> But do not imagine that I claim any merit in being so punctual; on the contrary I assure you, that it is a far greater Gratification to me to write to you, than to spend the Evening either at a Concert or a Ball </s>
<s> Mr Marlowe is so desirous of my appearing at some of the Public places every evening that I do not like to refuse him, but at the same time so much wish to remain at Home, that independant of the Pleasure I experience in devoting any portion of my Time to my Dear Eloisa, yet the Liberty I claim from having a letter to write of spending an Evening at home with my little Boy, you know me well enough to be sensible, will of itself be a sufficient Inducement (if one is necessary) to my maintaining with Pleasure a Correspondence with you </s>
<s> As to the subject of your letters to me, whether grave or merry, if they concern you they must be equally interesting to me; not but that I think the melancholy Indulgence of your own sorrows by repeating them and dwelling on them to me, will only encourage and increase them, and that it will be more prudent in you to avoid so sad a subject; but yet knowing as I do what a soothing and melancholy Pleasure it must afford you, I cannot prevail on myself to deny you so great an Indulgence, and will only insist on your not expecting me to encourage you in it, by my own letters; on the contrary I intend to fill them with such lively Wit and enlivening Humour as shall even provoke a smile in the sweet but sorrowfull countenance of my Eloisa </s>
<s> In the first place you are to learn that I have met your sisters three freinds Lady Lesley and her Daughters, twice in Public since I have been here </s>
<s> I know you will be impatient to hear my opinion of the Beauty of three Ladies of whom you have heard so much </s>
<s> Now, as you are too ill and too unhappy to be vain, I think I may venture to inform you that I like none of their faces so well as I do your own </s>
<s> Yet they are all handsome--Lady Lesley indeed I have seen before; her Daughters I beleive would in general be said to have a finer face than her Ladyship, and yet what with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a little Affectation and a great deal of small-talk, (in each of which she is superior to the young Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself as many admirers as the more regular features of Matilda, and Margaret </s>
<s> I am sure you will agree with me in saying that they can none of them be of a proper size for real Beauty, when you know that two of them are taller and the other shorter than ourselves </s>
<s> In spite of this Defect (or rather by reason of it) there is something very noble and majestic in the figures of the Miss Lesleys, and something agreably lively in the appearance of their pretty little Mother-in-law </s>
<s> But tho' one may be majestic and the other lively, yet the faces of neither possess that Bewitching sweetness of my Eloisas, which her present languor is so far from diminushing </s>
<s> What would my Husband and Brother say of us, if they knew all the fine things I have been saying to you in this letter </s>
<s> It is very hard that a pretty woman is never to be told she is so by any one of her own sex without that person's being suspected to be either her determined Enemy, or her professed Toad-eater </s>
<s> How much more amiable are women in that particular </s>
<s> One man may say forty civil things to another without our supposing that he is ever paid for it, and provided he does his Duty by our sex, we care not how Polite he is to his own </s>
<s> Mrs Lutterell will be so good as to accept my compliments, Charlotte, my Love, and Eloisa the best wishes for the recovery of her Health and Spirits that can be offered by her affectionate Freind E </s>

<s> LETTER the TENTH From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Portman Square April 13th MY DEAR CHARLOTTE We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month, and arrived safely in London after a Journey of seven Days; I had the pleasure of finding your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you have my grateful Thanks </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> my dear Freind I every day more regret the serene and tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange for the uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City </s>
<s> Not that I will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements are in the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them extremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that every appearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those unhappy Beings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho' it is out of my power to return </s>
<s> In short my Dear Charlotte it is my sensibility for the sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike of the extreme admiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so celebrated both in Public, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops, that are the reasons why I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so various and pleasing of London </s>
<s> How often have I wished that I possessed as little Personal Beauty as you do; that my figure were as inelegant; my face as unlovely; and my appearance as unpleasing as yours </s>
<s> But ah </s>
<s> what little chance is there of so desirable an Event; I have had the small-pox, and must therefore submit to my unhappy fate </s>
<s> I am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has long disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to require the most inviolable Secrecy from you </s>
<s> Last Monday se'night Matilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs Kickabout's; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable young Man in the main, tho' perhaps a little singular in his Taste--He is in love with Matilda-- </s>
<s> We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the Lady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when my Attention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely of his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another Gentleman and Lady </s>
<s> From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain that on him depended the future Happiness of my Life </s>
<s> Imagine my surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of Cleveland--I instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol </s>
<s> Mr and Mrs M </s>
<s> were the gentleman and Lady who accompanied him </s>
<s> (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The elegant address of Mr Cleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my attachment </s>
<s> He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he would have said, had he opened his Mouth </s>
<s> I can picture to myself the cultivated Understanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which would have shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland </s>
<s> The approach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented the Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we had never commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself </s>
<s> But oh </s>
<s> how inferior are the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so greatly envied Rival </s>
<s> Sir James is one of the most frequent of our Visitors, and is almost always of our Parties </s>
<s> We have since often met Mr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland--he is always engaged some where else </s>
<s> Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time I see her by her tiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa </s>
<s> She is so stupid </s>
<s> I live in the hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to Lady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes </s>
<s> Our party will be Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself </s>
<s> We see little of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> my poor Fortune where art thou by this time </s>
<s> We see more of Lady L </s>
<s> who always makes her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time </s>
<s> Alas </s>
<s> what Delightful Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau's </s>
<s> Yet I wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she must be sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little diminutive figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that she can not know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the most studied apparel </s>
<s> Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how greatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on our fine majestic figures </s>
<s> And how surprising it is that such an Idea should never have occurred to HER </s>
<s> I am sure if I have reflected in this manner once, I have fifty times </s>
<s> Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in them such reflections immediately come across me </s>
<s> My own Mother's Jewels too </s>
<s> But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject--let me entertain you with something more pleasing--Matilda had a letter this morning from Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples has turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope's Bulls for annulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and Fortune </s>
<s> He tells us moreover that much the same sort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless Louisa who is likewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married to a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished merit </s>
<s> He says, that they are at present very good Freinds, have quite forgiven all past errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours </s>
<s> He invites Matilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his little Louisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally desirous of beholding </s>
<s> As to our accepting his invitation, it is at Present very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of time; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts of the Propriety of such a scheme--she owns it would be very agreable </s>
<s> I am certain she likes the Fellow </s>
<s> My Father desires us not to be in a hurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months both he and Lady Lesley will do themselves the pleasure of attending us </s>
<s> Lady Lesley says no, that nothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements of Brighthelmstone for a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother </s>
<s> "No (says the disagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found it did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again".So says her Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that perhaps in a month or two, they may accompany us </s>

<s> George Austen, this work is inscribed with all due respect by THE AUTHOR </s>
<s> N.B </s>
<s> There will be very few Dates in this History </s>
<s> THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HENRY the 4th Henry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own satisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and predecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the rest of his life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be murdered </s>
<s> It is to be supposed that Henry was married, since he had certainly four sons, but it is not in my power to inform the Reader who was his wife </s>
<s> Be this as it may, he did not live for ever, but falling ill, his son the Prince of Wales came and took away the crown; whereupon the King made a long speech, for which I must refer the Reader to Shakespear's Plays, and the Prince made a still longer </s>
<s> Things being thus settled between them the King died, and was succeeded by his son Henry who had previously beat Sir William Gascoigne </s>
<s> HENRY the 5th This Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed and amiable, forsaking all his dissipated companions, and never thrashing Sir William again </s>
<s> During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt alive, but I forget what for </s>
<s> His Majesty then turned his thoughts to France, where he went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt </s>
<s> He afterwards married the King's daughter Catherine, a very agreable woman by Shakespear's account </s>
<s> In spite of all this however he died, and was succeeded by his son Henry </s>
<s> HENRY the 6th I cannot say much for this Monarch's sense </s>
<s> Nor would I if I could, for he was a Lancastrian </s>
<s> I suppose you know all about the Wars between him and the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had better read some other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in this, meaning by it only to vent my spleen AGAINST, and shew my Hatred TO all those people whose parties or principles do not suit with mine, and not to give information </s>
<s> This King married Margaret of Anjou, a Woman whose distresses and misfortunes were so great as almost to make me who hate her, pity her </s>
<s> It was in this reign that Joan of Arc lived and made such a ROW among the English </s>
<s> They should not have burnt her--but they did </s>
<s> There were several Battles between the Yorkists and Lancastrians, in which the former (as they ought) usually conquered </s>
<s> At length they were entirely overcome; The King was murdered--The Queen was sent home--and Edward the 4th ascended the Throne </s>
<s> EDWARD the 4th This Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of which the Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour in marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient proofs </s>
<s> His Wife was Elizabeth Woodville, a Widow who, poor Woman </s>
<s> was afterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and Avarice Henry the 7th </s>
<s> One of Edward's Mistresses was Jane Shore, who has had a play written about her, but it is a tragedy and therefore not worth reading </s>
<s> Having performed all these noble actions, his Majesty died, and was succeeded by his son </s>
<s> EDWARD the 5th This unfortunate Prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to draw his picture </s>
<s> He was murdered by his Uncle's Contrivance, whose name was Richard the 3rd </s>
<s> RICHARD the 3rd The Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated by Historians, but as he was a YORK, I am rather inclined to suppose him a very respectable Man </s>
<s> It has indeed been confidently asserted that he killed his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also been declared that he did not kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to beleive true; and if this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he did not kill his Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of York, why might not Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard </s>
<s> Whether innocent or guilty, he did not reign long in peace, for Henry Tudor E </s>
<s> of Richmond as great a villain as ever lived, made a great fuss about getting the Crown and having killed the King at the battle of Bosworth, he succeeded to it </s>
<s> HENRY the 7th This Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of York, by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right inferior to hers, tho' he pretended to the contrary </s>
<s> By this Marriage he had two sons and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was married to the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being grandmother to one of the first Characters in the World </s>
<s> But of HER, I shall have occasion to speak more at large in future </s>
<s> The youngest, Mary, married first the King of France and secondly the D </s>
<s> of Suffolk, by whom she had one daughter, afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey, who tho' inferior to her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an amiable young woman and famous for reading Greek while other people were hunting </s>
<s> It was in the reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel before mentioned made their appearance, the former of whom was set in the stocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was beheaded with the Earl of Warwick, and the latter was taken into the Kings kitchen </s>
<s> His Majesty died and was succeeded by his son Henry whose only merit was his not being quite so bad as his daughter Elizabeth </s>
<s> HENRY the 8th It would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were not as well acquainted with the particulars of this King's reign as I am myself </s>
<s> It will therefore be saving THEM the task of reading again what they have read before, and MYSELF the trouble of writing what I do not perfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the principal Events which marked his reign </s>
<s> Among these may be ranked Cardinal Wolsey's telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that "he was come to lay his bones among them," the reformation in Religion and the King's riding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen </s>
<s> It is however but Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was entirely innocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of which her Beauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not to mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the Charges against her, and the King's Character; all of which add some confirmation, tho' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those before alledged in her favour </s>
<s> Tho' I do not profess giving many dates, yet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice of those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it right to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of May </s>
<s> The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince, were too numerous to be mentioned, (as this history I trust has fully shown;) and nothing can be said in his vindication, but that his abolishing Religious Houses and leaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has been of infinite use to the landscape of England in general, which probably was a principal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why should a Man who was of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which had for ages been established in the Kingdom </s>
<s> His Majesty's 5th Wife was the Duke of Norfolk's Neice who, tho' universally acquitted of the crimes for which she was beheaded, has been by many people supposed to have led an abandoned life before her Marriage--of this however I have many doubts, since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the Queen of Scotland's cause, and who at last fell a victim to it </s>
<s> The Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with difficulty effected it </s>
<s> He was succeeded by his only son Edward </s>
<s> EDWARD the 6th As this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father's death, he was considered by many people as too young to govern, and the late King happening to be of the same opinion, his mother's Brother the Duke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority </s>
<s> This Man was on the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat of a favourite with me, tho' I would by no means pretend to affirm that he was equal to those first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or Gilpin </s>
<s> He was beheaded, of which he might with reason have been proud, had he known that such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but as it was impossible that he should be conscious of what had never happened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with the manner of it </s>
<s> After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had the care of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of both so well that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his daughter in law the Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading Greek </s>
<s> Whether she really understood that language or whether such a study proceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was always rather remarkable, is uncertain </s>
<s> Whatever might be the cause, she preserved the same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what was generally esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for she declared herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while conducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another in Greek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally passing that way </s>
<s> MARY This woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of England, in spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of her Cousins Mary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey </s>
<s> Nor can I pity the Kingdom for the misfortunes they experienced during her Reign, since they fully deserved them, for having allowed her to succeed her Brother--which was a double peice of folly, since they might have foreseen that as she died without children, she would be succeeded by that disgrace to humanity, that pest of society, Elizabeth </s>
<s> Many were the people who fell martyrs to the protestant Religion during her reign; I suppose not fewer than a dozen </s>
<s> She married Philip King of Spain who in her sister's reign was famous for building Armadas </s>
<s> She died without issue, and then the dreadful moment came in which the destroyer of all comfort, the deceitful Betrayer of trust reposed in her, and the Murderess of her Cousin succeeded to the Throne.---- ELIZABETH It was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad Ministers---Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have committed such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men connived at, and encouraged her in her Crimes </s>
<s> I know that it has by many people been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis Walsingham, and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State were deserving, experienced, and able Ministers </s>
<s> But oh </s>
<s> how blinded such writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit despised, neglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they reflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their Country and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining for the space of nineteen years, a WOMAN who if the claims of Relationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who condescended to place confidence in her, had every reason to expect assistance and protection; and at length in allowing Elizabeth to bring this amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and scandalous Death </s>
<s> Can any one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot, this everlasting blot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any praise to Lord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> what must this bewitching Princess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose only ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was abandoned by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and vilified by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when informed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death </s>
<s> Yet she bore it with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her Religion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she was doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from conscious Innocence </s>
<s> And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible that some hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that steadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so much credit </s>
<s> But this is a striking proof of THEIR narrow souls and prejudiced Judgements who accuse her </s>
<s> She was executed in the Great Hall at Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of February 1586--to the everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers, and of England in general </s>
<s> It may not be unnecessary before I entirely conclude my account of this ill-fated Queen, to observe that she had been accused of several crimes during the time of her reigning in Scotland, of which I now most seriously do assure my Reader that she was entirely innocent; having never been guilty of anything more than Imprudencies into which she was betrayed by the openness of her Heart, her Youth, and her Education </s>
<s> Having I trust by this assurance entirely done away every Suspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in the Reader's mind, from what other Historians have written of her, I shall proceed to mention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth's reign </s>
<s> It was about this time that Sir Francis Drake the first English Navigator who sailed round the World, lived, to be the ornament of his Country and his profession </s>
<s> Yet great as he was, and justly celebrated as a sailor, I cannot help foreseeing that he will be equalled in this or the next Century by one who tho' now but young, already promises to answer all the ardent and sanguine expectations of his Relations and Freinds, amongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom this work is dedicated, and my no less amiable self </s>
<s> Though of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere of Life, yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an Earl, as Drake was in that of a Sailor, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex </s>
<s> This unfortunate young Man was not unlike in character to that equally unfortunate one FREDERIC DELAMERE </s>
<s> The simile may be carried still farther, and Elizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the Emmeline of Delamere </s>
<s> It would be endless to recount the misfortunes of this noble and gallant Earl </s>
<s> It is sufficient to say that he was beheaded on the 25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after having clapped his hand on his sword, and after performing many other services to his Country </s>
<s> Elizabeth did not long survive his loss, and died so miserable that were it not an injury to the memory of Mary I should pity her </s>
<s> JAMES the 1st Though this King had some faults, among which and as the most principal, was his allowing his Mother's death, yet considered on the whole I cannot help liking him </s>
<s> He married Anne of Denmark, and had several Children; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died before his father or he might have experienced the evils which befell his unfortunate Brother </s>
<s> As I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with infinite regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any Member of it: yet Truth being I think very excusable in an Historian, I am necessitated to say that in this reign the roman Catholics of England did not behave like Gentlemen to the protestants </s>
<s> Their Behaviour indeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of Parliament might justly be considered by them as very uncivil, and even Sir Henry Percy tho' certainly the best bred man of the party, had none of that general politeness which is so universally pleasing, as his attentions were entirely confined to Lord Mounteagle </s>
<s> Sir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and is by many people held in great veneration and respect--But as he was an enemy of the noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of him, and must refer all those who may wish to be acquainted with the particulars of his life, to Mr Sheridan's play of the Critic, where they will find many interesting anecdotes as well of him as of his friend Sir Christopher Hatton.--His Majesty was of that amiable disposition which inclines to Freindship, and in such points was possessed of a keener penetration in discovering Merit than many other people </s>
<s> I once heard an excellent Sharade on a Carpet, of which the subject I am now on reminds me, and as I think it may afford my Readers some amusement to FIND IT OUT, I shall here take the liberty of presenting it to them </s>
<s> SHARADE My first is what my second was to King James the 1st, and you tread on my whole </s>
<s> The principal favourites of his Majesty were Car, who was afterwards created Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share in the above mentioned Sharade, and George Villiers afterwards Duke of Buckingham </s>
<s> On his Majesty's death he was succeeded by his son Charles </s>
<s> CHARLES the 1st This amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to those of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve since he was her descendant </s>
<s> Never certainly were there before so many detestable Characters at one time in England as in this Period of its History; never were amiable men so scarce </s>
<s> The number of them throughout the whole Kingdom amounting only to FIVE, besides the inhabitants of Oxford who were always loyal to their King and faithful to his interests </s>
<s> The names of this noble five who never forgot the duty of the subject, or swerved from their attachment to his Majesty, were as follows--The King himself, ever stedfast in his own support--Archbishop Laud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke of Ormond, who were scarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause </s>
<s> While the VILLIANS of the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I shall therefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang </s>
<s> Cromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be considered as the original Causers of all the disturbances, Distresses, and Civil Wars in which England for many years was embroiled </s>
<s> In this reign as well as in that of Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my attachment to the Scotch, to consider them as equally guilty with the generality of the English, since they dared to think differently from their Sovereign, to forget the Adoration which as STUARTS it was their Duty to pay them, to rebel against, dethrone and imprison the unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to deceive, and to sell the no less unfortunate Charles </s>
<s> The Events of this Monarch's reign are too numerous for my pen, and indeed the recital of any Events (except what I make myself) is uninteresting to me; my principal reason for undertaking the History of England being to Prove the innocence of the Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself with having effectually done, and to abuse Elizabeth, tho' I am rather fearful of having fallen short in the latter part of my scheme.--As therefore it is not my intention to give any particular account of the distresses into which this King was involved through the misconduct and Cruelty of his Parliament, I shall satisfy myself with vindicating him from the Reproach of Arbitrary and tyrannical Government with which he has often been charged </s>
<s> This, I feel, is not difficult to be done, for with one argument I am certain of satisfying every sensible and well disposed person whose opinions have been properly guided by a good Education--and this Argument is that he was a STUART </s>

<s> They both assured me that they would ever remember my advice with Gratitude, and follow it with attention; That they were prepared to find a World full of things to amaze and to shock them: but that they trusted their behaviour would never give me reason to repent the Watchful Care with which I had presided over their infancy and formed their Minds--" "With such expectations and such intentions (cried I) I can have nothing to fear from you--and can chearfully conduct you to Mrs Cope's without a fear of your being seduced by her Example, or contaminated by her Follies </s>

<s> Why should I feel it more, why should it wound me deeper than those I have experienced before </s>
<s> Can it be that I have a greater affection for Willoughby than I had for his amiable predecessors </s>

<s> I must suppose my dear Belle that this is the Case, since I am not conscious of being more sincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville, Fitzowen, or either of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the most lasting affection that ever warmed a Woman's heart </s>

<s> There is something so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more than Mortal </s>
<s> Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I could not help telling her how much she engaged my admiration-- </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> Miss Jane (said I)--and stopped from an inability at the moment of expressing myself as I could wish--Oh </s>
<s> Miss Jane--(I repeated)--I could not think of words to suit my feelings--She seemed waiting for my speech-- </s>
<s> I was confused--distressed--my thoughts were bewildered--and I could only add--"How do you do" </s>

<s> Then repeating the following line which was an extempore and equally adapted to recommend both Riding and Candour-- "Ride where you may, Be Candid where you can," she added," I rode once, but it is many years ago--She spoke this in so low and tremulous a Voice, that I was silent-- </s>

<s> "Then why are you called Miss Jane" </s>
<s> "I married, my Sophia without the consent or knowledge of my father the late Admiral Annesley </s>

<s> "I have only to add my dear Sophia, that my Henry's elder Brother dieing about the same time, Lady Bridget became a Widow like myself, and as we had always loved each other in idea from the high Character in which we had ever been spoken of, though we had never met, we determined to live together </s>
<s> We wrote to one another on the same subject by the same post, so exactly did our feeling and our actions coincide </s>

<s> LETTER the THIRD From a YOUNG LADY in distressed Circumstances to her freind A few days ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham </s>
<s> As my Mother never goes out she entrusted me to the care of Lady Greville who did me the honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to sit forwards, which is a favour about which I am very indifferent especially as I know it is considered as confering a great obligation on me "So Miss Maria (said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the door of the Carriage) you seem very smart to night--MY poor Girls will appear quite to disadvantage by YOU--I only hope your Mother may not have distressed herself to set YOU off </s>
<s> Have you got a new Gown on" </s>
<s> "Yes Ma'am" </s>
<s> replied I with as much indifference as I could assume </s>
<s> "Aye, and a fine one too I think--(feeling it, as by her permission I seated myself by her) I dare say it is all very smart--But I must own, for you know I always speak my mind, that I think it was quite a needless piece of expence--Why could not you have worn your old striped one </s>
<s> It is not my way to find fault with People because they are poor, for I always think that they are more to be despised and pitied than blamed for it, especially if they cannot help it, but at the same time I must say that in my opinion your old striped Gown would have been quite fine enough for its Wearer--for to tell you the truth (I always speak my mind) I am very much afraid that one half of the people in the room will not know whether you have a Gown on or not--But I suppose you intend to make your fortune to night-- </s>
<s> Well, the sooner the better; and I wish you success" </s>
<s> "Indeed Ma'am I have no such intention--" "Who ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter" </s>
<s> Miss Greville laughed but I am sure Ellen felt for me </s>
<s> "Was your Mother gone to bed before you left her" </s>
<s> said her Ladyship </s>
<s> "Dear Ma'am, said Ellen it is but nine o'clock" </s>
<s> "True Ellen, but Candles cost money, and Mrs Williams is too wise to be extravagant" </s>
<s> "She was just sitting down to supper Ma'am" </s>
<s> "And what had she got for supper" </s>
<s> "I did not observe" </s>
<s> "Bread and Cheese I suppose" </s>
<s> "I should never wish for a better supper" </s>
<s> said Ellen </s>
<s> "You have never any reason replied her Mother, as a better is always provided for you" </s>
<s> Miss Greville laughed excessively, as she constantly does at her Mother's wit </s>
<s> Such is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while riding in her Ladyship's Coach--I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother is always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my way in the world </s>
<s> She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady Greville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her House, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of being abused for my Poverty while I am in them.--When we arrived at Ashburnham, it was nearly ten o'clock, which was an hour and a half later than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too fashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual </s>
<s> The Dancing however was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville </s>
<s> I had not been long in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just as we were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got his white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them </s>
<s> In the mean time the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went exactly before me--She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me though there were several people close to us, "Hey day, Miss Maria </s>
<s> What cannot you get a partner </s>
<s> Poor Young Lady </s>
<s> I am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing </s>
<s> But do not despair; perhaps you may get a hop before the Evening is over" </s>
<s> So saying, she passed on without hearing my repeated assurance of being engaged, and leaving me very much provoked at being so exposed before every one--Mr Bernard however soon returned and by coming to me the moment he entered the room, and leading me to the Dancers my Character I hope was cleared from the imputation Lady Greville had thrown on it, in the eyes of all the old Ladies who had heard her speech </s>
<s> I soon forgot all my vexations in the pleasure of dancing and of having the most agreable partner in the room </s>
<s> As he is moreover heir to a very large Estate I could see that Lady Greville did not look very well pleased when she found who had been his Choice--She was determined to mortify me, and accordingly when we were sitting down between the dances, she came to me with more than her usual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and said loud enough to be heard by half the people in the room, "Pray Miss Maria in what way of business was your Grandfather </s>
<s> for Miss Mason and I cannot agree whether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder" </s>
<s> I saw that she wanted to mortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent her seeing that her scheme succeeded </s>
<s> "Neither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant" </s>
<s> "Aye, I knew he was in some such low way--He broke did not he" </s>
<s> "I beleive not Ma'am" </s>
<s> "Did not he abscond" </s>
<s> "I never heard that he did" </s>
<s> "At least he died insolvent" </s>
<s> "I was never told so before" </s>
<s> "Why, was not your FATHER as poor as a Rat" "I fancy not" </s>
<s> "Was not he in the Kings Bench once" </s>
<s> "I never saw him there" </s>
<s> She gave me SUCH a look, and turned away in a great passion; while I was half delighted with myself for my impertinence, and half afraid of being thought too saucy </s>
<s> As Lady Greville was extremely angry with me, she took no further notice of me all the Evening, and indeed had I been in favour I should have been equally neglected, as she was got into a Party of great folks and she never speaks to me when she can to anyone else </s>
<s> Miss Greville was with her Mother's party at supper, but Ellen preferred staying with the Bernards and me </s>
<s> We had a very pleasant Dance and as Lady G--slept all the way home, I had a very comfortable ride </s>
<s> The next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville's Coach stopped at the door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it should </s>
<s> She sent in a message by the servant to say that "she should not get out but that Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door, as she wanted to speak to her, and that she must make haste and come immediately--" "What an impertinent Message Mama" </s>
<s> said I--"Go Maria--" replied she--Accordingly I went and was obliged to stand there at her Ladyships pleasure though the Wind was extremely high and very cold </s>
<s> "Why I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last night--But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that you may dine with us the day after tomorrow--Not tomorrow, remember, do not come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas Stanley's family--There will be no occasion for your being very fine for I shant send the Carriage--If it rains you may take an umbrella--" I could hardly help laughing at hearing her give me leave to keep myself dry--"And pray remember to be in time, for I shant wait--I hate my Victuals over-done--But you need not come before the time--How does your Mother do </s>
<s> She is at dinner is not she" </s>
<s> "Yes Ma'am we were in the middle of dinner when your Ladyship came" </s>
<s> "I am afraid you find it very cold Maria" </s>
<s> said Ellen </s>
<s> "Yes, it is an horrible East wind--said her Mother--I assure you I can hardly bear the window down--But you are used to be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made your Complexion so rudely and coarse </s>
<s> You young Ladies who cannot often ride in a Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in, or how the wind shews your legs </s>
<s> I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as you do in such a day as this </s>
<s> But some sort of people have no feelings either of cold or Delicacy--Well, remember that we shall expect you on Thursday at 5 o'clock--You must tell your Maid to come for you at night--There will be no Moon--and you will have an horrid walk home--My compts to Your Mother--I am afraid your dinner will be cold--Drive on--" And away she went, leaving me in a great passion with her as she always does </s>

<s> I was extremely pleased with her appearance, for added to the charms of an engaging face, her manner and voice had something peculiarly interesting in them </s>
<s> So much so, that they inspired me with a great curiosity to know the history of her Life, who were her Parents, where she came from, and what had befallen her, for it was then only known that she was a relation of Mr Evelyn, and that her name was Grenville </s>
<s> In the evening a favourable opportunity offered to me of attempting at least to know what I wished to know, for every one played at Cards but Mrs Evelyn, My Mother, Dr Drayton, Miss Grenville and myself, and as the two former were engaged in a whispering Conversation, and the Doctor fell asleep, we were of necessity obliged to entertain each other </s>
<s> This was what I wished and being determined not to remain in ignorance for want of asking, I began the Conversation in the following Manner </s>

<s> Do you find it equal to the one you have left" </s>
<s> "Much superior Ma'am in point of Beauty" </s>
<s> She sighed </s>
<s> I longed to know for why </s>
<s> "But the face of any Country however beautiful said I, can be but a poor consolation for the loss of one's dearest Freinds" </s>
<s> She shook her head, as if she felt the truth of what I said </s>
<s> My Curiosity was so much raised, that I was resolved at any rate to satisfy it </s>
<s> "You regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville" </s>
<s> "Indeed I do" </s>
<s> "You were born there I suppose" </s>

<s> "Perfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals, and no one has a right to expect uninterrupted Happiness.--Some Misfortunes I have certainly met with" </s>
<s> "WHAT Misfortunes dear Ma'am </s>
<s> replied I, burning with impatience to know every thing </s>
<s> "NONE Ma'am I hope that have been the effect of any wilfull fault in me" </s>
<s> "I dare say not Ma'am, and have no doubt but that any sufferings you may have experienced could arise only from the cruelties of Relations or the Errors of Freinds" </s>
<s> She sighed--"You seem unhappy my dear Miss Grenville--Is it in my power to soften your Misfortunes" </s>
<s> "YOUR power Ma'am replied she extremely surprised; it is in NO ONES power to make me happy" </s>
<s> She pronounced these words in so mournfull and solemn an accent, that for some time I had not courage to reply </s>
<s> I was actually silenced </s>
<s> I recovered myself however in a few moments and looking at her with all the affection I could, "My dear Miss Grenville said I, you appear extremely young--and may probably stand in need of some one's advice whose regard for you, joined to superior Age, perhaps superior Judgement might authorise her to give it </s>
<s> I am that person, and I now challenge you to accept the offer I make you of my Confidence and Freindship, in return to which I shall only ask for yours--" "You are extremely obliging Ma'am--said she--and I am highly flattered by your attention to me--But I am in no difficulty, no doubt, no uncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted </s>

<s> I intend to send him the following in answer to his Letter tomorrow </s>
<s> My dearest Musgrove-- </s>
<s> Words cannot express how happy your Letter made me; I thought I should have cried for joy, for I love you better than any body in the World </s>
<s> I think you the most amiable, and the handsomest Man in England, and so to be sure you are </s>
<s> I never read so sweet a Letter in my Life </s>
<s> Do write me another just like it, and tell me you are in love with me in every other line </s>
<s> I quite die to see you </s>
<s> How shall we manage to see one another </s>
<s> for we are so much in love that we cannot live asunder </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> my dear Musgrove you cannot think how impatiently I wait for the death of my Uncle and Aunt--If they will not Die soon, I beleive I shall run mad, for I get more in love with you every day of my Life </s>
<s> How happy your Sister is to enjoy the pleasure of your Company in her house, and how happy every body in London must be because you are there </s>
<s> I hope you will be so kind as to write to me again soon, for I never read such sweet Letters as yours </s>
<s> I am my dearest Musgrove most truly and faithfully yours for ever and ever Henrietta Halton </s>
<s> I hope he will like my answer; it is as good a one as I can write though nothing to his; Indeed I had always heard what a dab he was at a Love-letter </s>
<s> I saw him you know for the first time at Lady Scudamores--And when I saw her Ladyship afterwards she asked me how I liked her Cousin Musgrove </s>
<s> "Why upon my word said I, I think he is a very handsome young Man" </s>
<s> "I am glad you think so replied she, for he is distractedly in love with you" </s>
<s> "Law </s>
<s> Lady Scudamore said I, how can you talk so ridiculously" </s>
<s> "Nay, t'is very true answered she, I assure you, for he was in love with you from the first moment he beheld you" </s>
<s> "I wish it may be true said I, for that is the only kind of love I would give a farthing for--There is some sense in being in love at first sight" </s>
<s> "Well, I give you Joy of your conquest, replied Lady Scudamore, and I beleive it to have been a very complete one; I am sure it is not a contemptible one, for my Cousin is a charming young fellow, has seen a great deal of the World, and writes the best Love-letters I ever read" </s>
<s> This made me very happy, and I was excessively pleased with my conquest </s>
<s> However, I thought it was proper to give myself a few Airs--so I said to her-- "This is all very pretty Lady Scudamore, but you know that we young Ladies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have no fortune at all" </s>
<s> "My dear Miss Halton said she, I am as much convinced of that as you can be, and I do assure you that I should be the last person to encourage your marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune with you </s>
<s> Mr Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of several hundreds an year which is capable of great Improvement, and an excellent House, though at Present it is not quite in repair" </s>
<s> "If that is the case replied I, I have nothing more to say against him, and if as you say he is an informed young Man and can write a good Love-letter, I am sure I have no reason to find fault with him for admiring me, tho' perhaps I may not marry him for all that Lady Scudamore" </s>
<s> "You are certainly under no obligation to marry him answered her Ladyship, except that which love himself will dictate to you, for if I am not greatly mistaken you are at this very moment unknown to yourself, cherishing a most tender affection for him" </s>
<s> "Law, Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a thing" </s>
<s> "Because every look, every word betrays it, answered she; Come my dear Henrietta, consider me as a freind, and be sincere with me--Do not you prefer Mr Musgrove to any man of your acquaintance" </s>
<s> "Pray do not ask me such questions Lady Scudamore, said I turning away my head, for it is not fit for me to answer them" </s>
<s> "Nay my Love replied she, now you confirm my suspicions </s>
<s> But why Henrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love, or why refuse to confide in me" </s>
<s> "I am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage </s>
<s> I do not refuse to confide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove, that I am sincerely attached to him, for it is no disgrace to love a handsome Man </s>
<s> If he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be ashamed of a passion which must have been mean since the object would have been unworthy </s>
<s> But with such a figure and face, and such beautiful hair as your Cousin has, why should I blush to own that such superior merit has made an impression on me" </s>
<s> "My sweet Girl (said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection) what a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters, and what a quick discernment for one of your years </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> how I honour you for such Noble Sentiments" </s>
<s> "Do you Ma'am said I; You are vastly obliging </s>
<s> But pray Lady Scudamore did your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like him the better if he did, for what is a Lover without a Confidante" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> my Love replied she, you were born for each other </s>
<s> Every word you say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the invisible power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so exactly coincide </s>
<s> Nay, the colour of your Hair is not very different </s>
<s> Yes my dear Girl, the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the story of his Love-- </s>
<s> Nor was I surprised at it--I know not how it was, but I had a kind of presentiment that he would be in love with you" </s>
<s> "Well, but how did he break it to you" </s>
<s> "It was not till after supper </s>
<s> We were sitting round the fire together talking on indifferent subjects, though to say the truth the Conversation was cheifly on my side for he was thoughtful and silent, when on a sudden he interrupted me in the midst of something I was saying, by exclaiming in a most Theatrical tone-- Yes I'm in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me "Oh </s>
<s> What a sweet way replied I, of declaring his Passion </s>
<s> To make such a couple of charming lines about me </s>
<s> What a pity it is that they are not in rhime" </s>
<s> "I am very glad you like it answered she; To be sure there was a great deal of Taste in it </s>
<s> And are you in love with her, Cousin </s>
<s> said I </s>
<s> I am very sorry for it, for unexceptionable as you are in every respect, with a pretty Estate capable of Great improvements, and an excellent House tho' somewhat out of repair, yet who can hope to aspire with success to the adorable Henrietta who has had an offer from a Colonel and been toasted by a Baronet"--"THAT I have--" cried I </s>
<s> Lady Scudamore continued </s>
<s> "Ah dear Cousin replied he, I am so well convinced of the little Chance I can have of winning her who is adored by thousands, that I need no assurances of yours to make me more thoroughly so </s>
<s> Yet surely neither you or the fair Henrietta herself will deny me the exquisite Gratification of dieing for her, of falling a victim to her Charms </s>
<s> And when I am dead"--continued her-- "Oh Lady Scudamore, said I wiping my eyes, that such a sweet Creature should talk of dieing" </s>
<s> "It is an affecting Circumstance indeed, replied Lady Scudamore" </s>
<s> "When I am dead said he, let me be carried and lain at her feet, and perhaps she may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains" </s>
<s> "Dear Lady Scudamore interrupted I, say no more on this affecting subject </s>
<s> I cannot bear it" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> how I admire the sweet sensibility of your Soul, and as I would not for Worlds wound it too deeply, I will be silent" </s>
<s> "Pray go on" </s>
<s> said I </s>
<s> She did so </s>
<s> "And then added he, Ah </s>
<s> Cousin imagine what my transports will be when I feel the dear precious drops trickle on my face </s>
<s> Who would not die to haste such extacy </s>
<s> And when I am interred, may the divine Henrietta bless some happier Youth with her affection, May he be as tenderly attached to her as the hapless Musgrove and while HE crumbles to dust, May they live an example of Felicity in the Conjugal state" </s>
<s> Did you ever hear any thing so pathetic </s>
<s> What a charming wish, to be lain at my feet when he was dead </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> what an exalted mind he must have to be capable of such a wish </s>
<s> Lady Scudamore went on </s>
<s> "Ah </s>
<s> my dear Cousin replied I to him, such noble behaviour as this, must melt the heart of any woman however obdurate it may naturally be; and could the divine Henrietta but hear your generous wishes for her happiness, all gentle as is her mind, I have not a doubt but that she would pity your affection and endeavour to return it" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> Cousin answered he, do not endeavour to raise my hopes by such flattering assurances </s>
<s> No, I cannot hope to please this angel of a Woman, and the only thing which remains for me to do, is to die" </s>
<s> "True Love is ever desponding replied I, but I my dear Tom will give you even greater hopes of conquering this fair one's heart, than I have yet given you, by assuring you that I watched her with the strictest attention during the whole day, and could plainly discover that she cherishes in her bosom though unknown to herself, a most tender affection for you" </s>
<s> "Dear Lady Scudamore cried I, This is more than I ever knew" </s>
<s> "Did not I say that it was unknown to yourself </s>
<s> I did not, continued I to him, encourage you by saying this at first, that surprise might render the pleasure still Greater" </s>
<s> "No Cousin replied he in a languid voice, nothing will convince me that I can have touched the heart of Henrietta Halton, and if you are deceived yourself, do not attempt deceiving me" </s>
<s> "In short my Love it was the work of some hours for me to Persuade the poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference for him; but when at last he could no longer deny the force of my arguments, or discredit what I told him, his transports, his Raptures, his Extacies are beyond my power to describe" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> the dear Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me </s>
<s> But dear Lady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my Uncle and Aunt" </s>
<s> "Yes, I told him every thing" </s>
<s> "And what did he say" </s>
<s> "He exclaimed with virulence against Uncles and Aunts; Accused the laws of England for allowing them to Possess their Estates when wanted by their Nephews or Neices, and wished HE were in the House of Commons, that he might reform the Legislature, and rectify all its abuses" </s>
<s> "Oh </s>
<s> the sweet Man </s>
<s> What a spirit he has" </s>
<s> said I </s>
<s> "He could not flatter himself he added, that the adorable Henrietta would condescend for his sake to resign those Luxuries and that splendor to which she had been used, and accept only in exchange the Comforts and Elegancies which his limited Income could afford her, even supposing that his house were in Readiness to receive her </s>
<s> I told him that it could not be expected that she would; it would be doing her an injustice to suppose her capable of giving up the power she now possesses and so nobly uses of doing such extensive Good to the poorer part of her fellow Creatures, merely for the gratification of you and herself" </s>
<s> "To be sure said I, I AM very Charitable every now and then </s>
<s> And what did Mr Musgrove say to this" </s>
<s> "He replied that he was under a melancholy necessity of owning the truth of what I said, and that therefore if he should be the happy Creature destined to be the Husband of the Beautiful Henrietta he must bring himself to wait, however impatiently, for the fortunate day, when she might be freed from the power of worthless Relations and able to bestow herself on him" </s>

<s> Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably handsome, you never mentioned anything of her Sisters' beauty; yet they are certainly extremely pretty </s>
<s> I'll give you their description.--Julia is eighteen; with a countenance in which Modesty, Sense and Dignity are happily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace, Elegance and Symmetry </s>
<s> Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than her Sister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of Julia's, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as estimable </s>
<s> She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness the most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking </s>
<s> She appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her conversation during the half hour they set with us, was replete with humourous sallies, Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible, the amiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her own </s>
<s> Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received of him </s>
<s> My Father met him with that look of Love, that social Shake, and cordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and valued freind from whom thro' various circumstances he had been separated nearly twenty years </s>
<s> Mr Millar observed (and very justly too) that many events had befallen each during that interval of time, which gave occasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections on the many changes in their situation which so long a period had occasioned, on the advantages of some, and the disadvantages of others </s>
<s> From this subject she made a short digression to the instability of human pleasures and the uncertainty of their duration, which led her to observe that all earthly Joys must be imperfect </s>
<s> She was proceeding to illustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when the Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father and Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending five or six months with us on their return </s>
<s> We of course mentioned you, and I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all </s>
<s> "Louisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet sometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite </s>

<s> A TALE </s>
<s> A Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal, bought a small Cottage in Pembrokeshire about two years ago </s>
<s> This daring Action was suggested to him by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet for him, provided he would take a small house near the borders of an extensive Forest, and about three Miles from the Sea </s>
<s> Wilhelminus gladly accepted the offer and continued for some time searching after such a retreat when he was one morning agreably releived from his suspence by reading this advertisement in a Newspaper </s>

<s> It is ready furnished except two rooms and a Closet </s>
<s> The delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother, and shewed him the advertisement </s>
<s> Robertus congratulated him and sent him in his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage </s>
<s> After travelling for three days and six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest and following a track which led by it's side down a steep Hill over which ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour </s>
<s> Wilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without receiving any answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door which was fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room, which he immediately perceived to be one of the two that were unfurnished--From thence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare </s>
<s> A pair of stairs that went out of it led him into a room above, no less destitute, and these apartments he found composed the whole of the House </s>
<s> He was by no means displeased with this discovery, as he had the comfort of reflecting that he should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture himself-- </s>
<s> He returned immediately to his Brother, who took him the next day to every Shop in Town, and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the two rooms and the Closet, In a few days everything was completed, and Wilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage </s>
<s> Robertus accompanied him, with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely Sisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached, and a large number of Attendants.--An ordinary Genius might probably have been embarrassed, in endeavouring to accomodate so large a party, but Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the immediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest adjoining to the house </s>
<s> Their Construction was both simple and elegant--A couple of old blankets, each supported by four sticks, gave a striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in overcoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus's most striking Virtues </s>
