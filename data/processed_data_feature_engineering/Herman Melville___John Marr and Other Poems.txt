<s> JOHN MARR AND OTHER POEMS By HERMAN MELVILLE _With An Introductory Note By_ HENRY CHAPIN MCMXXII Introductory Note Melville's verse printed for the most part privately in small editions from middle life onward after his great prose work had been written, taken as a whole, is of an amateurish and uneven quality </s>
<s> In it, however, that loveable freshness of personality, which his philosophical dejection never quenched, is everywhere in evidence </s>
<s> It is clear that he did not set himself to master the poet's art, yet through the mask of conventional verse which often falls into doggerel, the voice of a true poet is heard </s>
<s> In selecting the pieces for this volume I have put in the vigorous sea verses of _John Marr_ in their entirety and added those others from his _Battle Pieces_, _Timoleon,_ etc, that best indicate the quality of their author's personality </s>
<s> The prose supplement to battle pieces has been included because it does so much to explain the feeling of his war verse and further because it is such a remarkably wise and clear commentary upon those confused and troublous days of post-war reconstruction </s>

<s> The frigate, heeling over, on the wave threw a dusk </s>
<s> Not sharing in the slant, the clapper of her bell The fixed metal struck--uinvoked struck the knell Of the _Cumberland_ stillettoed by the _Merrimac's_ tusk; While, broken in the wound underneath the gun-deck, Like a sword-fish's blade in leviathan waylaid, The tusk was left infixed in the fast-foundering wreck </s>

<s> But better, wife, I like to booze on the days Ere the Old Order foundered in these very frays, And tradition was lost and we learned strange ways </s>
<s> Often I think on the brave cruises then; Re-sailing them in memory, I hail the press o' men On the gunned promenade where rolling they go, Ere the dog-watch expire and break up the show </s>
<s> The Laced Caps I see between forward guns; Away from the powder-room they puff the cigar; "Three days more, hey, the donnas and the dons" </s>
<s> "Your Zeres widow, will you hunt her up, Starr" </s>
<s> The Laced Caps laugh, and the bright waves too; Very jolly, very wicked, both sea and crew, Nor heaven looks sour on either, I guess, Nor Pecksniff he bosses the gods' high mess </s>

<s> But king o' the club, the gayest golden spark, Sailor o' sailors, what sailor do I mark </s>
<s> Tom Tight, Tom Tight, no fine fellow finer, A cutwater nose, ay, a spirited soul; But, bowsing away at the well-brewed bowl, He never bowled back from that last voyage to China </s>
<s> Tom was lieutenant in the brig-o'-war famed When an officer was hung for an arch-mutineer, But a mystery cleaved, and the captain was blamed, And a rumpus too raised, though his honor it was clear </s>
<s> And Tom he would say, when the mousers would try him, And with cup after cup o' Burgundy ply him: "Gentlemen, in vain with your wassail you beset, For the more I tipple, the tighter do I get" </s>
<s> No blabber, no, not even with the can-- True to himself and loyal to his clan </s>
<s> Tom blessed us starboard and d--d us larboard, Right down from rail to the streak o' the garboard </s>
<s> Nor less, wife, we liked him.--Tom was a man In contrast queer with Chaplain Le Fan, Who blessed us at morn, and at night yet again, D--ning us only in decorous strain; Preaching 'tween the guns--each cutlass in its place-- From text that averred old Adam a hard case </s>
<s> I see him--Tom--on _horse-block_ standing, Trumpet at mouth, thrown up all amain, An elephant's bugle, vociferous demanding Of topmen aloft in the hurricane of rain, "Letting that sail there your faces flog </s>
<s> Manhandle it, men, and you'll get the good grog" </s>
<s> O Tom, but he knew a blue-jacket's ways, And how a lieutenant may genially haze; Only a sailor sailors heartily praise </s>
<s> Wife, where be all these chaps, I wonder </s>
<s> Trumpets in the tempest, terrors in the fray, Boomed their commands along the deck like thunder; But silent is the sod, and thunder dies away </s>

<s> No whit the less though judicious was enough In dealing with the Finn who made the great huff; Our three-decker's giant, a grand boatswain's mate, Manliest of men in his own natural senses; But driven stark mad by the devil's drugged stuff, Storming all aboard from his run-ashore late, Challenging to battle, vouchsafing no pretenses, A reeling King Ogg, delirious in power, The quarter-deck carronades he seemed to make cower </s>

<s> swaying a fist like Thor's sledge, And making the pigmy constables hedge-- Ship's corporals and the master-at-arms </s>
<s> "In _brig_ there, I say"!--They dally no more; Like hounds let slip on a desperate boar, Together they pounce on the formidable Finn, Pinion and cripple and hustle him in </s>
<s> Anon, under sentry, between twin guns, He slides off in drowse, and the long night runs </s>
<s> Morning brings a summons </s>
<s> Whistling it calls, Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain's four aids; Trilled down the hatchways along the dusk halls: _Muster to the Scourge!_--Dawn of doom and its blast </s>
<s> As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before the mast, Tumbling up the ladders from the ship's nether shades </s>
<s> Keeping in the background and taking small part, Lounging at their ease, indifferent in face, Behold the trim marines uncompromised in heart; Their Major, buttoned up, near the staff finds room-- The staff o' lieutenants standing grouped in their place </s>

<s> The angel o' the "brig" brings his prisoner up; Then, steadied by his old _Santa-Clara_, a sup, Heading all erect, the ranged assizes there, Lo, Captain Turret, and under starred bunting, (A florid full face and fine silvered hair,) Gigantic the yet greater giant confronting </s>
<s> Now the culprit he liked, as a tall captain can A Titan subordinate and true _sailor-man;_ And frequent he'd shown it--no worded advance, But flattering the Finn with a well-timed glance </s>
<s> But what of that now </s>
<s> In the martinet-mien Read the _Articles of War_, heed the naval routine; While, cut to the heart a dishonor there to win, Restored to his senses, stood the Anak Finn; In racked self-control the squeezed tears peeping, Scalding the eye with repressed inkeeping </s>
<s> Discipline must be; the scourge is deemed due </s>
<s> But ah for the sickening and strange heart- benumbing, Compassionate abasement in shipmates that view; Such a grand champion shamed there succumbing </s>
<s> "Brown, tie him up".--The cord he brooked: How else?--his arms spread apart--never threaping; No, never he flinched, never sideways he looked, Peeled to the waistband, the marble flesh creeping, Lashed by the sleet the officious winds urge </s>
<s> In function his fellows their fellowship merge-- The twain standing nigh--the two boatswain's mates, Sailors of his grade, ay, and brothers of his mess </s>

<s> SUPPLEMENT Were I fastidiously anxious for the symmetry of this book, it would close with the notes </s>
<s> But the times are such that patriotism--not free from solicitude--urges a claim overriding all literary scruples </s>
<s> It is more than a year since the memorable surrender, but events have not yet rounded themselves into completion </s>
<s> Not justly can we complain of this </s>
<s> There has been an upheaval affecting the basis of things; to altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be made; there are difficulties great and novel </s>
<s> But is Reason still waiting for Passion to spend itself </s>
<s> We have sung of the soldiers and sailors, but who shall hymn the politicians </s>
<s> In view of the infinite desirableness of Re-establishment, and considering that, so far as feeling is concerned, it depends not mainly on the temper in which the South regards the North, but rather conversely; one who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to submit some thoughts, counting on the indulgence of his countrymen </s>
<s> And, first, it may be said that, if among the feelings and opinions growing immediately out of a great civil convulsion, there are any which time shall modify or do away, they are presumably those of a less temperate and charitable cast </s>
<s> There seems no reason why patriotism and narrowness should go together, or why intellectual impartiality should be confounded with political trimming, or why serviceable truth should keep cloistered because not partisan </s>
<s> Yet the work of Reconstruction, if admitted to be feasible at all, demands little but common sense and Christian charity </s>
<s> Little but these </s>
<s> These are much </s>
<s> Some of us are concerned because as yet the South shows no penitence </s>
<s> But what exactly do we mean by this </s>
<s> Since down to the close of the war she never confessed any for braving it, the only penitence now left her is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture; and since this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical, it would be unworthy in us to demand it </s>
<s> Certain it is that penitence, in the sense of voluntary humiliation, will never be displayed </s>
<s> Nor does this afford just ground for unreserved condemnation </s>
<s> It is enough, for all practical purposes, if the South have been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel that Secession, like Slavery, is against Destiny; that both now lie buried in one grave; that her fate is linked with ours; and that together we comprise the Nation </s>
<s> The clouds of heroes who battled for the Union it is needless to eulogize here </s>
<s> But how of the soldiers on the other side </s>
<s> And when of a free community we name the soldiers, we thereby name the people </s>
<s> It was in subserviency to the slave-interest that Secession was plotted; but it was under the plea, plausibly urged, that certain inestimable rights guaranteed by the Constitution were directly menaced, that the people of the South were cajoled into revolution </s>
<s> Through the arts of the conspirators and the perversity of fortune, the most sensitive love of liberty was entrapped into the support of a war whose implied end was the erecting in our advanced century of an Anglo-American empire based upon the systematic degradation of man </s>
<s> Spite this clinging reproach, however, signal military virtues and achievements have conferred upon the Confederate arms historic fame, and upon certain of the commanders a renown extending beyond the sea--a renown which we of the North could not suppress, even if we would </s>
<s> In personal character, also, not a few of the military leaders of the South enforce forbearance; the memory of others the North refrains from disparaging; and some, with more or less of reluctance, she can respect </s>
<s> Posterity, sympathizing with our convictions, but removed from our passions, may perhaps go farther here </s>
<s> If George IV could, out of the graceful instinct of a gentleman, raise an honorable monument in the great fane of Christendom over the remains of the enemy of his dynasty, Charles Edward, the invader of England and victor in the rout of Preston Pans--upon whose head the king's ancestor but one reign removed had set a price--is it probable that the granchildren of General Grant will pursue with rancor, or slur by sour neglect, the memory of Stonewall Jackson </s>
<s> But the South herself is not wanting in recent histories and biographies which record the deeds of her chieftains--writings freely published at the North by loyal houses, widely read here, and with a deep though saddened interest </s>
<s> By students of the war such works are hailed as welcome accessories, and tending to the completeness of the record </s>
<s> Supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities, then, in the generation next to come, Southerners there will be yielding allegiance to the Union, feeling all their interests bound up in it, and yet cherishing unrebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers of the fallen Confederacy that Burns, Scott, and the Ettrick Shepherd felt for the memory of the gallant clansmen ruined through their fidelity to the Stuarts--a feeling whose passion was tempered by the poetry imbuing it, and which in no wise affected their loyalty to the Georges, and which, it may be added, indirectly contributed excellent things to literature </s>
<s> But, setting this view aside, dishonorable would it be in the South were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness warred in her behalf, though from motives, as we believe, so deplorably astray </s>
<s> Patriotism is not baseness, neither is it inhumanity </s>
<s> The mourners who this summer bear flowers to the mounds of the Virginian and Georgian dead are, in their domestic bereavement and proud affection, as sacred in the eye of Heaven as are those who go with similar offerings of tender grief and love into the cemeteries of our Northern martyrs </s>
<s> And yet, in one aspect, how needless to point the contrast </s>
<s> Cherishing such sentiments, it will hardly occasion surprise that, in looking over the battle-pieces in the foregoing collection, I have been tempted to withdraw or modify some of them, fearful lest in presenting, though but dramatically and by way of poetic record, the passions and epithets of civil war, I might be contributing to a bitterness which every sensible American must wish at an end </s>
<s> So, too, with the emotion of victory as reproduced on some pages, and particularly toward the close </s>
<s> It should not be construed into an exultation misapplied--an exultation as ungenerous as unwise, and made to minister, however indirectly, to that kind of censoriousness too apt to be produced in certain natures by success after trying reverses </s>
<s> Zeal is not of necessity religion, neither is it always of the same essence with poetry or patriotism </s>
<s> There are excesses which marked the conflict, most of which are perhaps inseparable from a civil strife so intense and prolonged, and involving warfare in some border countries new and imperfectly civilized </s>
<s> Barbarities also there were, for which the Southern people collectively can hardly be held responsible, though perpetrated by ruffians in their name </s>
<s> But surely other qualities--exalted ones--courage and fortitude matchless, were likewise displayed, and largely; and justly may these be held the characteristic traits, and not the former </s>
<s> In this view, what Northern writer, however patriotic, but must revolt from acting on paper a part any way akin to that of the live dog to the dead lion; and yet it is right to rejoice for our triumphs, so far as it may justly imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity </s>
<s> Let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads for reasonable consideration for our late enemies, now stricken down and unavoidably debarred, for the time, from speaking through authorized agencies for themselves </s>
<s> Nothing has been urged here in the foolish hope of conciliating those men--few in number, we trust--who have resolved never to be reconciled to the Union </s>
<s> On such hearts everything is thrown away except it be religious commiseration, and the sincerest </s>
<s> Yet let them call to mind that unhappy Secessionist, not a military man, who with impious alacrity fired the first shot of the Civil War at Sumter, and a little more than four years afterward fired the last one into his heart at Richmond </s>
<s> Noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion surprised the people in a utilitarian time and country; yet the glory of the war falls short of its pathos--a pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity </s>
<s> How many and earnest thoughts still rise, and how hard to repress them </s>
<s> We feel what past years have been, and years, unretarded years, shall come </s>
<s> May we all have moderation; may we all show candor </s>
<s> Though, perhaps, nothing could ultimately have averted the strife, and though to treat of human actions is to deal wholly with second causes, nevertheless, let us not cover up or try to extenuate what, humanly speaking, is the truth--namely, that those unfraternal denunciations, continued through years, and which at last inflamed to deeds that ended in bloodshed, were reciprocal; and that, had the preponderating strength and the prospect of its unlimited increase lain on the other side, on ours might have lain those actions which now in our late opponents we stigmatize under the name of Rebellion </s>
<s> As frankly let us own--what it would be unbecoming to parade were foreigners concerned-- that our triumph was won not more by skill and bravery than by superior resources and crushing numbers; that it was a triumph, too, over a people for years politically misled by designing men, and also by some honestly-erring men, who from their position could not have been otherwise than broadly influential; a people who, though, indeed, they sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery, and even extend it, were not the authors of it, but (less fortunate, not less righteous than we), were the fated inheritors; a people who, having a like origin with ourselves, share essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess </s>
<s> No one can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless defeat has now cast upon Secession by withholding the recognition of these verities </s>
<s> Surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of pacification, based upon principles operating equally all over the land, which lovers of their country yearn for, and which our arms, though signally triumphant, did not bring about, and which lawmaking, however anxious, or energetic, or repressive, never by itself can achieve, may yet be largely aided by generosity of sentiment public and private </s>
<s> Some revisionary legislation and adaptive is indispensable; but with this should harmoniously work another kind of prudence, not unallied with entire magnanimity </s>
<s> Benevolence and policy--Christianity and Machiavelli--dissuade from penal severities toward the subdued </s>
<s> Abstinence here is as obligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate fellowmen late in bonds, and, if observed, would equally prove to be wise forecast </s>
<s> The great qualities of the South, those attested in the War, we can perilously alienate, or we may make them nationally available at need </s>
<s> The blacks, in their infant pupilage to freedom, appeal to the sympathies of every humane mind </s>
<s> The paternal guardianship which for the interval government exercises over them was prompted equally by duty and benevolence </s>
<s> Yet such kindliness should not be allowed to exclude kindliness to communities who stand nearer to us in nature </s>
<s> For the future of the freed slaves we may well be concerned; but the future of the whole country, involving the future of the blacks, urges a paramount claim upon our anxiety </s>
<s> Effective benignity, like the Nile, is not narrow in its bounty, and true policy is always broad </s>
<s> To be sure, it is vain to seek to glide, with moulded words, over the difficulties of the situation </s>
<s> And for them who are neither partisans, nor enthusiasts, nor theorists, nor cynics, there are some doubts not readily to be solved </s>
<s> And there are fears </s>
<s> Why is not the cessation of war now at length attended with the settled calm of peace </s>
<s> Wherefore in a clear sky do we still turn our eyes toward the South as the Neapolitan, months after the eruption, turns his toward Vesuvius </s>
<s> Do we dread lest the repose may be deceptive </s>
<s> In the recent convulsion has the crater but shifted Let us revere that sacred uncertainty which forever impends over men and nations </s>
<s> Those of us who always abhorred slavery as an atheistical iniquity, gladly we join in the exulting chorus of humanity over its downfall </s>
<s> But we should remember that emancipation was accomplished not by deliberate legislation; only through agonized violence could so mighty a result be effected </s>
<s> In our natural solicitude to confirm the benefit of liberty to the blacks, let us forbear from measures of dubious constitutional rightfulness toward our white countrymen--measures of a nature to provoke, among other of the last evils, exterminating hatred of race toward race </s>
<s> In imagination let us place ourselves in the unprecedented position of the Southerners--their position as regards the millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their midst, for whom some of us now claim the suffrage </s>
<s> Let us be Christians toward our fellow-whites, as well as philanthropists toward the blacks, our fellow-men </s>
<s> In all things, and toward all, we are enjoined to do as we would be done by </s>
<s> Nor should we forget that benevolent desires, after passing a certain point, can not undertake their own fulfillment without incurring the risk of evils beyond those sought to be remedied </s>
<s> Something may well be left to the graduated care of future legislation, and to heaven </s>
<s> In one point of view the co-existence of the two races in the South, whether the negro be bond or free, seems (even as it did to Abraham Lincoln) a grave evil </s>
<s> Emancipation has ridded the country of the reproach, but not wholly of the calamity </s>
<s> Especially in the present transition period for both races in the South, more or less of trouble may not unreasonably be anticipated; but let us not hereafter be too swift to charge the blame exclusively in any one quarter </s>
<s> With certain evils men must be more or less patient </s>
<s> Our institutions have a potent digestion, and may in time convert and assimilate to good all elements thrown in, however originally alien </s>
<s> But, so far as immediate measures looking toward permanent Re- establishment are concerned, no consideration should tempt us to pervert the national victory into oppression for the vanquished </s>
<s> Should plausible promise of eventual good, or a deceptive or spurious sense of duty, lead us to essay this, count we must on serious consequences, not the least of which would be divisions among the Northern adherents of the Union </s>
<s> Assuredly, if any honest Catos there be who thus far have gone with us, no longer will they do so, but oppose us, and as resolutely as hitherto they have supported </s>
<s> But this path of thought leads toward those waters of bitterness from which one can only turn aside and be silent </s>
<s> But supposing Re-establishment so far advanced that the Southern seats in Congress are occupied, and by men qualified in accordance with those cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have prevailed in the land--what then </s>
<s> Why, the Congressmen elected by the people of the South will--represent the people of the South </s>
<s> This may seem a flat conclusion; but, in view of the last five years, may there not be latent significance in it </s>
<s> What will be the temper of those Southern members </s>
<s> and, confronted by them, what will be the mood of our own representatives </s>
<s> In private life true reconciliation seldom follows a violent quarrel; but, if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable, nice observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new rupture </s>
<s> Amity itself can only be maintained by reciprocal respect, and true friends are punctilious equals </s>
<s> On the floor of Congress North and South are to come together after a passionate duel, in which the South, though proving her valor, has been made to bite the dust </s>
<s> Upon differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged </s>
<s> Shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant self-assertion on the other </s>
<s> Shall Manassas and Chickamauga be retorted for Chattanooga and Richmond </s>
<s> Under the supposition that the full Congress will be composed of gentlemen, all this is impossible </s>
<s> Yet, if otherwise, it needs no prophet of Israel to foretell the end </s>
<s> The maintenance of Congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with the North </s>
<s> Rightly will more forbearance be required from the North than the South, for the North is victor </s>
<s> But some there are who may deem these latter thoughts inapplicable, and for this reason: Since the test-oath operatively excludes from Congress all who in any way participated in Secession, therefore none but Southerners wholly in harmony with the North are eligible to seats </s>
<s> This is true for the time being </s>
<s> But the oath is alterable; and in the wonted fluctuations of parties not improbably it will undergo alteration, assuming such a form, perhaps, as not to bar the admission into the National Legislature of men who represent the populations lately in revolt </s>
<s> Such a result would involve no violation of the principles of democratic government </s>
<s> Not readily can one perceive how the political existence of the millions of late Secessionists can permanently be ignored by this Republic </s>
<s> The years of the war tried our devotion to the Union; the time of peace may test the sincerity of our faith in democracy </s>
<s> In no spirit of opposition, not by way of challenge, is anything here thrown out </s>
<s> These thoughts are sincere ones; they seem natural-- inevitable </s>
<s> Here and there they must have suggested themselves to many thoughtful patriots </s>
<s> And, if they be just thoughts, ere long they must have that weight with the public which already they have had with individuals </s>
<s> For that heroic band--those children of the furnace who, in regions like Texas and Tennessee, maintained their fidelity through terrible trials--we of the North felt for them, and profoundly we honor them </s>
<s> Yet passionate sympathy, with resentments so close as to be almost domestic in their bitterness, would hardly in the present juncture tend to discreet legislation </s>
<s> Were the Unionists and Secessionists but as Guelphs and Ghibellines </s>
<s> If not, then far be it from a great nation now to act in the spirit that animated a triumphant town-faction in the Middle Ages </s>
<s> But crowding thoughts must at last be checked; and, in times like the present, one who desires to be impartially just in the expression of his views, moves as among sword-points presented on every side </s>
<s> Let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy of our time may not have been enacted without instructing our whole beloved country through terror and pity; and may fulfillment verify in the end those expectations which kindle the bards of Progress and Humanity </s>

<s> Shun Orcus; win the moonlit land Belulled--the silent meadows lone, Where never any leaf is blown From lily-stem in Azrael's hand </s>
<s> There, till her love rejoin her lowly (Pensive, a shade, but all her own) On honey feed her, wild and holy; Or trance her with thy choicest charm </s>
<s> And if, ere yet the lover's free, Some added dusk thy rule decree-- That shadow only let it be Thrown in the moon-glade by the palm </s>
<s> EPILOGUE _If Luther's day expand to Darwin's year,_ _Shall that exclude the hope--foreclose the fear?_ Unmoved by all the claims our times avow, The ancient Sphinx still keeps the porch of shade; And comes Despair, whom not her calm may cow, And coldly on that adamantine brow Scrawls undeterred his bitter pasquinade </s>
<s> But Faith (who from the scrawl indignant turns) With blood warm oozing from her wounded trust, Inscribes even on her shards of broken urns The sign o' the cross--_the spirit above the dust!_ Yea, ape and angel, strife and old debate-- The harps of heaven and dreary gongs of hell; Science the feud can only aggravate-- No umpire she betwixt the chimes and knell: The running battle of the star and clod Shall run forever--if there be no God </s>
<s> Degrees we know, unknown in days before; The light is greater, hence the shadow more; And tantalized and apprehensive Man Appealing--Wherefore ripen us to pain </s>
<s> Seems there the spokesman of dumb Nature's train </s>
<s> But through such strange illusions have they passed Who in life's pilgrimage have baffled striven-- Even death may prove unreal at the last, And stoics be astounded into heaven </s>
<s> Then keep thy heart, though yet but ill-resigned-- Clarel, thy heart, the issues there but mind; That like the crocus budding through the snow-- That like a swimmer rising from the deep-- That like a burning secret which doth go Even from the bosom that would hoard and keep; Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming sea, And prove that death but routs life into victory </s>
