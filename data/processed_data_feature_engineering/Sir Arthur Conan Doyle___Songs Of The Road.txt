<s> Ah, give me a horse, To bear me out afar, Where blackest need and grimmest deed, And sweetest perils are </s>

<s> A heart </s>
<s> A heart </s>
<s> Ah, give me a heart, To rise to circumstance </s>
<s> Serene and high, and bold to try The hazard of a chance </s>

<s> THE ARAB STEED [10] I gave the 'orse 'is evenin' feed, And bedded of 'im down, And went to 'ear the sing-song In the bar-room of the Crown, And one young feller spoke a piece As told a kind of tale, About an Arab man wot 'ad A certain 'orse for sale </s>
<s> I 'ave no grudge against the man &mdash; I never 'eard 'is name, But if he was my closest pal I'd say the very same, For wot you do in other things Is neither 'ere nor there, [11] But w'en it comes to 'orses You must keep upon the square </s>
<s> Now I'm tellin' you the story Just as it was told last night, And if I wrong this Arab man Then 'e can set me right; But s'posin' all these fac's are fac's, Then I make bold to say That I think it was not sportsmanlike To act in sich a way </s>
<s> For, as I understand the thing, 'E went to sell this steed &mdash; Which is a name they give a 'orse Of some outlandish breed &mdash;, And soon 'e found a customer, A proper sportin' gent, Who planked 'is money down at once Without no argument </s>
<s> [12] Now when the deal was finished And the money paid, you'd think This Arab would 'ave asked the gent At once to name 'is drink, Or at least 'ave thanked 'im kindly, An' wished 'im a good day, And own as 'e'd been treated In a very 'andsome way </s>
<s> But instead o' this 'e started A-talkin' to the steed, And speakin' of its "braided mane" An' of its "winged speed," And other sich expressions With which I can't agree, For a 'orse with wings an' braids an' things Is not the 'orse for me </s>
<s> [13] The moment that 'e 'ad the cash &mdash; Or wot 'e called the gold, 'E turned as nasty as could be: Says 'e, "You're sold </s>
<s> You're sold" </s>
<s> Them was 'is words; it's not for me To settle wot he meant; It may 'ave been the 'orse was sold, It may 'ave been the gent </s>
<s> I've not a word to say agin His fondness for 'is 'orse, But why should 'e insinivate The gent would treat 'im worse </s>
<s> An' why should 'e go talkin' In that aggravatin' way, As if the gent would gallop 'im And wallop 'im all day </s>
<s> [14] It may 'ave been an' 'arness 'orse, It may 'ave been an 'ack, But a bargain is a bargain, An' there ain't no goin' back; For when you've picked the money up, That finishes the deal, And after that your mouth is shut, Wotever you may feel </s>
<s> Supposin' this 'ere Arab man 'Ad wanted to be free, 'E could 'ave done it businesslike, The same as you or me; A fiver might 'ave squared the gent, An' then 'e could 'ave claimed As 'e'd cleared 'imself quite 'andsome, And no call to be ashamed </s>
<s> [15] But instead 'o that this Arab man Went on from bad to worse, An' took an' chucked the money At the cove wot bought the 'orse; 'E'd 'ave learned 'im better manners, If 'e'd waited there a bit, But 'e scooted on 'is bloomin' steed As 'ard as 'e could split </s>
<s> Per'aps 'e sold 'im after, Or per'aps 'e 'ires 'im out, But I'd like to warm that Arab man Wen next 'e comes about; For wot 'e does in other things Is neither 'ere nor there, But w'en it comes to 'orses We must keep 'im on the square </s>
<s> A POST-IMPRESSIONIST [16] Peter Wilson, A.R.A., In his small atelier, Studied Continental Schools, Drew by Academic rules </s>
<s> So he made his bid for fame, But no golden answer came, For the fashion of his day Chanced to set the other way, And decadent forms of Art Drew the patrons of the mart </s>
<s> Now this poor reward of merit Rankled so in Peter's spirit, It was more than he could bear; [17] So one night in mad despair He took his canvas for the year ("Isle of Wight from Southsea Pier"), And he hurled it from his sight, Hurled it blindly to the night, Saw it fall diminuendo From the open lattice window, Till it landed with a flop On the dust-bin's ashen top, Where, 'mid damp and rain and grime, It remained till morning time </s>
<s> Then when morning brought reflection, He was shamed at his dejection, And he thought with consternation Of his poor, ill-used creation; Down he rushed, and found it there Lying all exposed and bare, [18] Mud-bespattered, spoiled, and botched, Water sodden, fungus-blotched, All the outlines blurred and wavy, All the colours turned to gravy, Fluids of a dappled hue, Blues on red and reds on blue, A pea-green mother with her daughter, Crazy boats on crazy water Steering out to who knows what, An island or a lobster-pot </s>
<s> Oh, the wretched man's despair </s>
<s> Was it lost beyond repair </s>
<s> Swift he bore it from below, Hastened to the studio, Where with anxious eyes he studied If the ruin, blotched and muddied, Could by any human skill Be made a normal picture still </s>
<s> [19] Thus in most repentant mood Unhappy Peter Wilson stood, When, with pompous face, self-centred, Willoughby the critic entered &mdash; He of whom it has been said He lives a century ahead &mdash; And sees with his prophetic eye The forms which Time will justify, A fact which surely must abate All longing to reincarnate </s>
<s> "Ah, Wilson," said the famous man, Turning himself the walls to scan, "The same old style of thing I trace, Workmanlike but commonplace </s>
<s> Believe me, sir, the work that lives Must furnish more than Nature gives </s>
<s> 'The light that never was,' you know, That is your mark but here, hullo </s>

<s> You've far outcried the latest cry&mdash; Out Monet-ed Monet </s>
<s> I have said Our Art was sleeping, but not dead </s>
<s> Long have we waited for the Star, I watched the skies for it afar, The hour has come&mdash;and here you are" </s>
<s> [21] And that is how our artist friend Found his struggles at an end, And from his little Chelsea flat Became the Park Lane plutocrat </s>
<s> 'Neath his sheltered garden wall When the rain begins to fall, And the stormy winds do blow, You may see them in a row, Red effects and lake and yellow Getting nicely blurred and mellow </s>

<s> You're a nailer, so you are </s>
<s> I thought I should 'ave choked you off with that 'ere motor-car </s>
<s> Well, mister, 'ere's another; and, mind you, it's a fact, Though you'll think perhaps I copped it out o' some blue ribbon tract </s>
<s> It was in the days when farmer men were jolly-faced and stout, For all the cash was comin' in and little goin' out, [27] But now, you see, the farmer men are 'ungry-faced and thin, For all the cash is goin' out and little comin' in </s>
<s> But in the days I'm speakin' of, before the drop in wheat, The life them farmers led was such as couldn't well be beat; They went the pace amazin', they 'unted and they shot, And this 'ere Jeremiah Brown the liveliest of the lot </s>
<s> 'E was a fine young fellar; the best roun' 'ere by far, But just a bit full-blooded, as fine young fellars are; [28] Which I know they didn't ought to, an' it's very wrong of course, But the colt wot never capers makes a mighty useless 'orse </s>
<s> The lad was never vicious, but 'e made the money go, For 'e was ready with 'is "yes," and back- ward with 'is "no" </s>
<s> And so 'e turned to drink which is the avenoo to 'ell, An' 'ow 'e came to stop 'imself is wot' I 'ave to tell </s>
<s> Four days on end 'e never knew 'ow 'e 'ad got to bed, Until one mornin' fifty clocks was tickin' in 'is 'ead, [29] And on the same the doctor came, "You're very near D.T., If you don't stop yourself, young chap, you'll pay the price," said 'e </s>
<s> "It takes the form of visions, as I fear you'll quickly know; Perhaps a string o' monkeys, all a-sittin' in a row, Perhaps it's frogs or beetles, perhaps it's rats or mice, There are many sorts of visions and there's none of 'em is nice" </s>
<s> But Brown 'e started laughin': "No doctor's muck," says 'e, "A take-'em-break-'em gallop is the only cure for me </s>
<s> [30] They 'unt to-day down 'Orsham way </s>
<s> Bring round the sorrel mare, If them monkeys come inquirin' you can send 'em on down there" </s>
<s> Well, Jeremiah rode to 'ounds, exactly as 'e said </s>
<s> But all the time the doctor's words were ringin' in 'is 'ead &mdash; "If you don't stop yourself, young chap, you've got to pay the price, There are many sorts of visions, but none of 'em is nice" </s>
<s> They found that day at Leonards Lee and ran to Shipley Wood, 'Ell-for-leather all the way, with scent and weather good </s>
<s> [31] Never a check to 'Orton Beck and on across the Weald, And all the way the Sussex clay was weed- in' out the field </s>
<s> There's not a man among them could remember such a run, Straight as a rule to Bramber Pool and on by Annington, They followed still past Breeding 'ill and on by Steyning Town, Until they'd cleared the 'edges and were out upon the Down </s>
<s> Full thirty mile from Plimmers Style, without a check or fault, Full thirty mile the 'ounds 'ad run and never called a 'alt </s>

<s> And then the 'untsman 'e was beat </s>
<s> 'Is 'orse 'ad tripped and fell </s>
<s> "By George," said Brown, "I'll go alone, and follow it to well, The place that it belongs to" </s>
<s> And as 'e made the vow, There broke from right in front of 'im the queerest kind of row </s>
<s> There lay a copse of 'azels on the border of the track, And into this two 'ounds 'ad run them two was all the pack &mdash; [33] And now from these 'ere 'azels there came a fearsome 'owl, With a yappin' and a snappin' and a wicked snarlin' growl </s>
<s> Jeremiah's blood ran cold a frightened man was 'e, But he butted through the bushes just to see what 'e could see, And there beneath their shadow, blood drippin' from his jaws, Was an awful creature standin' with a 'ound beneath its paws </s>
<s> A fox </s>
<s> Five foxes rolled in one a pony's weight and size, A rampin', ragin' devil, all fangs and 'air and eyes; [34] Too scared to speak, with shriek on shriek, Brown galloped from the sight With just one thought within 'is mind &mdash; "The doctor told me right" </s>
<s> That evenin' late the minister was seated in his study, When in there rushed a 'untin' man, all travel-stained and muddy, "Give me the Testament" </s>
<s> he cried, "And 'ear my sacred vow, That not one drop of drink shall ever pass my lips from now" </s>
<s> 'E swore it and 'e kept it and 'e keeps it to this day, 'E 'as turned from gin to ginger and says 'e finds it pay, [35] You can search the whole o' Sussex from 'ere to Brighton Town, And you wouldn't find a better man than Jeremiah Brown </s>
<s> And the vision it was just a wolf, a big Siberian, A great, fierce, 'ungry devil from a show- man's caravan, But it saved 'im from perdition and I don't mind if I do, I 'aven't seen no wolf myself so 'ere's my best to you </s>

<s> Did you see the bay horse </s>
<s> Such a one to go </s>
<s> He took a bit of ridin', When I showed him at the Show </s>
<s> [37] First prize the broad jump, First prize the high; Gold medal, Class A, You'll see it by-and-by </s>
<s> I bred the bay horse On the Withy Farm </s>
<s> I broke the bay horse, He broke my arm </s>
<s> Don't blame the bay horse, Blame the brittle bone, I bred him and I've fed him, And he's all my very own </s>
<s> Just watch the bay horse Chock full of sense </s>
<s> Ain't he just beautiful, Risin' to a fence </s>
<s> [38] Just hear the bay horse Whinin' in his stall, Purrin' like a pussy cat When he hears me call </s>

<s> Over the quarry edge, I'll sit him tight, If he wants the brown hide, He's welcome to the white </s>
<s> THE OUTCASTS [39] Three women stood by the river's flood In the gas-lamp's murky light, A devil watched them on the left, And an angel on the right </s>
<s> The clouds of lead flowed overhead; The leaden stream below; They marvelled much, that outcast three, Why Fate should use them so </s>
<s> Said one: "I have a mother dear, Who lieth ill abed, And by my sin the wage I win From which she hath her bread" </s>
<s> [40] Said one: "I am an outcast's child, And such I came on earth </s>
<s> If me ye blame, for this my shame, Whom blame ye for my birth" </s>
<s> The third she sank a sin-blotched face, And prayed that she might rest, In the weary flow of the stream below, As on her mother's breast </s>
<s> Now past there came a godly man, Of goodly stock and blood, And as he passed one frown he cast At that sad sisterhood </s>
<s> Sorely it grieved that godly man, To see so foul a sight, He turned his face, and strode apace, And left them to the night </s>
<s> [41] But the angel drew her sisters three, Within her pinions' span, And the crouching devil slunk away To join the godly man </s>
<s> THE END [42] "Tell me what to get and I will get it" </s>
<s> "Then get that picture that the girl in white" </s>
<s> "Now tell me where you wish that I should set it" </s>

<s> 1902-1909 [45] They recruited William Evans From the ploughtail and the spade; Ten years' service in the Devons Left him smart as they are made </s>
<s> Thirty or a trifle older, Rather over six foot high, Trim of waist and broad of shoulder, Yellow-haired and blue of eye; Short of speech and very solid, Fixed in purpose as a rock, Slow, deliberate, and stolid, Of the real West-country stock </s>
<s> [46] He had never been to college, Got his teaching in the corps, You can pick up useful knowledge 'Twixt Saltash and Singapore </s>
<s> Old Field-Cornet Piet van Celling Lived just northward of the Vaal, And he called his white-washed dwelling, Blesbock Farm, Rhenoster Kraal </s>
<s> In his politics unbending, Stern of speech and grim of face, He pursued the never-ending Quarrel with the English race </s>
<s> Grizzled hair and face of copper, Hard as nails from work and sport, [47] Just the model of a Dopper Of the fierce old fighting sort </s>
<s> With a shaggy bearded quota On commando at his order, He went off with Louis Botha Trekking for the British border </s>
<s> When Natal was first invaded He was fighting night and day, Then he scouted and he raided, With De Wet and Delaney </s>
<s> Till he had a brush with Plumer, Got a bullet in his arm, And returned in sullen humour To the shelter of his farm </s>
<s> [48] Now it happened that the Devons, Moving up in that direction, Sent their Colour-Sergeant Evans Foraging with half a section </s>
<s> By a friendly Dutchman guided, A Van Eloff or De Vilier, They were promptly trapped and hided, In a manner too familiar </s>
<s> When the sudden scrap was ended, And they sorted out the bag, Sergeant Evans lay extended Mauseritis in his leg </s>
<s> So the Kaffirs bore him, cursing, From the scene of his disaster, [49] And they left him to the nursing Of the daughters of their master </s>
<s> Now the second daughter, Sadie &mdash; But the subject why pursue </s>
<s> Wounded youth and tender lady, Ancient tale but ever new </s>
<s> On the stoep they spent the gloaming, Watched the shadows on the veldt, Or she led her cripple roaming To the eucalyptus belt </s>
<s> He would lie and play with Jacko, The baboon from Bushman's Kraal, Smoked Magaliesberg tobacco While she lisped to him in Taal </s>
<s> [50] Till he felt that he had rather He had died amid the slaughter, If the harshness of the father Were not softened in the daughter </s>
<s> So he asked an English question, And she answered him in Dutch, But her smile was a suggestion, And he treated it as such </s>
<s> Now among Rhenoster kopjes Somewhat northward of the Vaal, You may see four little chappies, Three can walk and one can crawl </s>
<s> And the blue of Transvaal heavens Is reflected in their eyes, [51] Each a little William Evans, Smaller model pocket size </s>
<s> Each a little Burgher Piet Of the hardy Boer race, Two great peoples seem to meet In the tiny sunburned face </s>
<s> And they often greatly wonder Why old granddad and Papa, Should have been so far asunder, Till united by mamma </s>
<s> And when asked, "Are you a Boer </s>
<s> Or a little Englishman" </s>
<s> Each will answer, short and sure, "I am a South African" </s>
<s> [52] But the father answers, chaffing, "Africans but British too" </s>
<s> And the children echo, laughing, "Half of mother half of you" </s>
<s> It may seem a crude example, In an isolated case, But the story is a sample Of the welding of the race </s>
<s> So from bloodshed and from sorrow, From the pains of yesterday, Comes the nation of to-morrow Broadly based and built to stay </s>
<s> Loyal spirits strong in union, Joined by kindred faith and blood; Brothers in the wide communion Of our sea-girt brotherhood </s>
<s> THE WANDERER {1} [53] 1 With acknowledgment to my friend Sir A </s>
<s> Quiller-Couch </s>
<s> 'Twas in the shadowy gloaming Of a cold and wet March day, That a wanderer came roaming From countries far away </s>
<s> Scant raiment had he round him, Nor purse, nor worldly gear, Hungry and faint we found him, And bade him welcome here </s>
<s> His weary frame bent double, His eyes were old and dim, His face was writhed with trouble Which none might share with him </s>
<s> [54] His speech was strange and broken, And none could understand, Such words as might be spoken In some far distant land </s>
<s> We guessed not whence he hailed from, Nor knew what far-off quay His roving bark had sailed from Before he came to me </s>
<s> But there he was, so slender, So helpless and so pale, That my wife's heart grew tender For one who seemed so frail </s>
<s> She cried, "But you must bide here </s>
<s> You shall no further roam </s>
<s> Grow stronger by our side here, Within our moorland home" </s>
<s> [55] She laid her best before him, Homely and simple fare, And to his couch she bore him The raiment he should wear </s>
<s> To mine he had been welcome, My suit of russet brown, But she had dressed our weary guest In a loose and easy gown </s>
<s> And long in peace he lay there, Brooding and still and weak, Smiling from day to day there At thoughts he would not speak </s>
<s> The months flowed on, but ever Our guest would still remain, Nor made the least endeavour To leave our home again </s>
<s> [56] He heeded not for grammar, Nor did we care to teach, But soon he learned to stammer Some words of English speech </s>
<s> With these our guest would tell us The things that he liked best, And order and compel us To follow his behest </s>
<s> He ruled us without malice, But as if he owned us all, A sultan in his palace With his servants at his call </s>
<s> Those calls came fast and faster, Our service still we gave, Till I who had been master Had grown to be his slave </s>
<s> [57] He claimed with grasping gestures Each thing of price he saw, Watches and rings and vestures, His will the only law </s>
<s> In vain had I commanded, In vain I struggled still, Servants and wife were banded To do the stranger's will </s>
<s> And then in deep dejection It came to me one day, That my own wife's affection Had been beguiled away </s>
<s> Our love had known no danger, So certain had it been </s>
<s> And now to think a stranger Should dare to step between </s>
<s> [58] I saw him lie and harken To the little songs she sung, And when the shadows darken I could hear his lisping tongue </s>
<s> They would sit in chambers shady, When the light was growing dim, Ah, my fickle-hearted lady </s>
<s> With your arm embracing him </s>
<s> So, at last, lest he divide us, I would put them to the test </s>
<s> There was no one there beside us, Save this interloping guest </s>
<s> So I took my stand before them, Very silent and erect, My accusing glance passed o'er them, Though with no observed effect </s>
<s> [59] But the lamp light shone upon her, And I saw each tell-tale feature, As I cried, "Now, on your honour, Do or don't you love the creature" </s>
<s> But her answer seemed evasive, It was "Ducky-doodle-doo </s>
<s> If his mummy loves um babby, Doesn't daddums love um too" </s>

<s> Half of him was whalebone, half of him was steel, Fightin' weight eleven ten, five foot nine in height, Always ready to oblige if you want a fight </s>
<s> I could talk of Bendigo from here to king- dom come, I guess before I ended you would wish your dad was dumb </s>
<s> I'd tell you how he fought Ben Caunt, and how the deaf 'un fell, But the game is done, and the men are gone and maybe it's as well </s>
<s> [62] Bendy he turned Methodist&mdash;he said he felt a call, He stumped the country preachin' and you bet he filled the hall, If you seed him in the pulpit, a-bleatin' like a lamb, You'd never know bold Bendigo, the pride of Nottingham </s>
<s> His hat was like a funeral, he'd got a waiter's coat, With a hallelujah collar and a choker round his throat, His pals would laugh and say in chaff that Bendigo was right, In takin' on the devil, since he'd no one else to fight </s>
<s> [63] But he was very earnest, improvin' day by day, A-workin' and a-preachin' just as his duty lay, But the devil he was waitin', and in the final bout, He hit him hard below his guard and knocked poor Bendy out </s>
<s> Now I'll tell you how it happened </s>
<s> He was preachin' down at Brum, He was billed just like a circus, you should see the people come, The chapel it was crowded, and in the fore- most row, There was half a dozen bruisers who'd a grudge at Bendigo </s>
<s> [64] There was Tommy Piatt of Bradford, Solly Jones of Perry Bar, Long Connor from the Bull Ring, the same wot drew with Carr, Jack Ball the fightin gunsmith, Joe Mur- phy from the Mews, And Iky Moss, the bettin' boss, the Champion of the Jews </s>
<s> A very pretty handful a-sittin' in a string, Full of beer and impudence, ripe for any- thing, Sittin' in a string there, right under Bendy's nose, If his message was for sinners, he could make a start on those </s>
<s> [65] Soon he heard them chaflin'; "Hi, Bendy </s>
<s> Here's a go" </s>
<s> "How much are you coppin' by this Jump to Glory show" </s>
<s> "Stow it, Bendy </s>
<s> Left the ring </s>
<s> Mighty spry of you </s>
<s> Didn't everybody know the ring was leavin' you" </s>
<s> Bendy fairly sweated as he stood above and prayed, "Look down, O Lord, and grip me with a strangle hold" </s>
<s> he said </s>
<s> "Fix me with a strangle hold </s>
<s> Put a stop on me </s>
<s> I'm slippin', Lord, I'm slippin' and I'm clingin' hard to Thee" </s>
<s> [66] But the roughs they kept on chaffin' and the uproar it was such That the preacher in the pulpit might be talkin' double Dutch, Till a workin' man he shouted out, a- jumpin' to his feet, "Give us a lead, your reverence, and heave 'em in the street" </s>
<s> Then Bendy said, "Good Lord, since first I left my sinful ways, Thou knowest that to Thee alone I've given up my days, But now, dear Lord"&mdash;and here he laid his Bible on the shelf&mdash; "I'll take, with your permission, just five minutes for myself" </s>
<s> [67] He vaulted from the pulpit like a tiger from a den, They say it was a lovely sight to see him floor his men; Right and left, and left and right, straight and true and hard, Till the Ebenezer Chapel looked more like a knacker's yard </s>
<s> Platt was standin' on his back and lookup at his toes, Solly Jones of Perry Bar was feelin' for his nose, Connor of the Bull Ring had all that he could do Rakin' for his ivories that lay about the pew </s>
<s> [68] Jack Ball the fightin' gunsmith was in a peaceful sleep, Joe Murphy lay across him, all tied up in a heap, Five of them was twisted in a tangle on the floor, And Iky Moss, the bettin' boss, had sprinted for the door </s>
<s> Five repentant fightin' men, sitting in a row, Listenin' to words of grace from Mister Bendigo, Listenin' to his reverence all as good as gold, Pretty little baa-lambs, gathered to the fold </s>
<s> [69] So that's the way that Bendy ran his mission in the slum, And preached the Holy Gospel to the fightin' men of Brum, "The Lord," said he, "has given me His message from on high, And if you interrupt Him, I will know the reason why" </s>
<s> But to think of all your schooling clean wasted, thrown away, Darned if I can make out what you're learnin' all the day, Grubbin' up old fairy-tales, fillin' up with cram, And didn't know of Bendigo, the pride of Nottingham </s>

<s> Ben Nevis towered on our right, The clouds concealed it from our sight, But it was comforting to say That over there Ben Nevis lay' </s>
<s> Finally we made the land At Fort William's sloping strand, And in our car away we went Along that lasting monument, The good broad causeway which was made By King George's General Wade </s>
<s> He built a splendid road, no doubt, Alas </s>
<s> he left the sign-posts out </s>
<s> And so we wandered, sad to say, Far from our appointed way, Till twenty mile of rugged track In a circle brought us back </s>
<s> But the incident we viwed [133] In a philosophic mood </s>
<s> Tired and hungry but serene We settled at the Bridge of Spean </s>
<s> Our journey now we onward press Toward the town of Inverness, Through a country all alive With memories of "forty-five" </s>
<s> The noble clans once gathered here, Where now are only grouse and deer </s>
<s> Alas, that men and crops and herds Should ever yield their place to birds </s>
<s> And that the splendid Highland race Be swept aside to give more space For forests where the deer may stray For some rich owner far away, Whose keeper guards the lonely glen Which once sent out a hundred men </s>
<s> When from Inverness we turned, [134] Feeling that a rest was earned </s>
<s> We stopped at Nairn, for golf links famed, "Scotland's Brighton" it is named, Though really, when the phrase we heard, It seemed a little bit absurd, For Brighton's size compared to Nairn Is just a mother to her bairn </s>
<s> We halted for a day of rest, But took one journey to the West To view old Cawdor's tower and moat Of which unrivalled Shakespeare wrote, Where once Macbeth, the schemer deep, Slew royal Duncan in his sleep, But actors since avenged his death By often murdering Macbeth </s>
<s> Hard by we saw the circles gray Where Druid priests were wont to pray </s>
<s> [135] Three crumbling monuments we found, With Stonehenge monoliths around, But who had built and who had planned We tried in vain to understand, As future learned men may search The reasons for our village church </s>
<s> This was our limit, for next day We turned upon, our homeward way, Passing first Culloden's plain Where the tombstones of the slain Loom above the purple heather </s>
<s> There the clansmen lie together &mdash; Men from many an outland skerry, Men from Athol and Glengarry, Camerons from wild Mamore, MacDonalds from the Irish Shore, Red MacGregors and McLeods With their tartans for their shrouds, Menzies, Malcolms from the islands, Frasers from the upper Highlands &mdash; Callous is the passer by Who can turn without a sigh From the tufts of heather deep Where the noble clansmen sleep </s>
<s> Now we swiftly made our way To Kingussie in Strathspey, Skirting many a nameless loch As we flew through Badenoch, Till at Killiecrankie's Pass, Heather changing into grass We descended once again To the fertile lowland plain, And by Perth and old Dunblane Reached the banks of Allan Water, Famous for the miller's daughter, Whence at last we circled back [137] Till we crossed our Stirling track </s>
<s> So our little journey ended, Gladness and instruction blended &mdash; Not a care to spoil our pleasure, Not a thought to break our leisure, Drifting on from Sussex hedges Up through Yorkshire's fells and ledges Past the deserts and morasses Of the dreary Border passes, Through the scenes of Scottish story Past the fields of battles gory </s>
<s> In the future it will seem To have been a happy dream, But unless my hopes are vain We may dream it soon again </s>
