<s> PROSERPINE & MIDAS Two unpublished Mythological Dramas by MARY SHELLEY Edited with Introduction by A </s>
<s> KOSZUL PREFATORY NOTE </s>
<s> The editor came across the unpublished texts included in this volume as early as 1905 </s>
<s> Perhaps he ought to apologize for delaying their appearance in print </s>
<s> The fact is he has long been afraid of overrating their intrinsic value </s>
<s> But as the great Shelley centenary year has come, perhaps this little monument of his wife's collaboration may take its modest place among the tributes which will be paid to his memory </s>
<s> For Mary Shelley's mythological dramas can at least claim to be the proper setting for some of the most beautiful lyrics of the poet, which so far have been read in undue isolation </s>
<s> And even as a literary sign of those times, as an example of that classical renaissance which the romantic period fostered, they may not be altogether negligible </s>
<s> These biographical and literary points have been dealt with in an introduction for which the kindest help was long ago received from the late Dr </s>
<s> Garnett and the late Lord Abinger </s>
<s> Sir Walter Raleigh was also among the first to give both encouragement and guidance </s>
<s> My friends M </s>
<s> Emile Pons and Mr Roger Ingpen have read the book in manuscript </s>
<s> The authorities of the Bodleian Library and of the Clarendon Press have been as generously helpful as is their well-known wont </s>
<s> To all the editor wishes to record his acknowledgements and thanks </s>

<s> INTRODUCTION </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> 'The compositions published in Mrs Shelley's lifetime afford but an inadequate conception of the intense sensibility and mental vigour of this extraordinary woman' </s>
<s> Thus wrote Dr </s>
<s> Garnett, in 1862 (Preface to his _Relics of Shelley_) </s>
<s> The words of praise may have sounded unexpectedly warm at that date </s>
<s> Perhaps the present volume will make the reader more willing to subscribe, or less inclined to demur </s>
<s> Mary Godwin in her younger days certainly possessed a fair share of that nimbleness of invention which generally characterizes women of letters </s>
<s> Her favourite pastime as a child, she herself testifies, [Footnote: Preface to the 1831 edition of _Frankenstein_.] had been to write stories </s>
<s> And a dearer pleasure had been--to use her own characteristic abstract and elongated way of putting it--'the following up trains of thought which had for their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents' </s>
<s> All readers of Shelley's life remember how later on, as a girl of nineteen--and a two years' wife--she was present, 'a devout but nearly silent listener', at the long symposia held by her husband and Byron in Switzerland (June 1816), and how the pondering over 'German horrors', and a common resolve to perpetrate ghost stories of their own, led her to imagine that most unwomanly of all feminine romances, _Frankenstein._ The paradoxical effort was paradoxically successful, and, as publishers' lists aver to this day, Frankenstein's monster has turned out to be the hardest-lived specimen of the 'raw-head-and-bloody-bones' school of romantic tales </s>
<s> So much, no doubt, to the credit of Mary Shelley </s>
<s> But more creditable, surely, is the fact that she was not tempted, as 'Monk' Lewis had been, to persevere in those lugubrious themes </s>
<s> Although her publishers--_et pour cause_--insisted on styling her 'the author of Frankenstein', an entirely different vein appears in her later productions </s>
<s> Indeed, a quiet reserve of tone, a slow, sober, and sedate bearing, are henceforth characteristic of all her literary attitudes </s>
<s> It is almost a case of running from one to the other extreme </s>
<s> The force of style which even adverse critics acknowledged in _Frankenstein_ was sometimes perilously akin to the most disputable kinds of romantic rant </s>
<s> But in the historical or society novels which followed, in the contributions which graced the 'Keepsakes' of the thirties, and even--alas--in the various prefaces and commentaries which accompanied the publication of so many poems of Shelley, his wife succumbed to an increasing habit of almost Victorian reticence and dignity </s>
<s> And those later novels and tales, though they sold well in their days and were kindly reviewed, can hardly boast of any reputation now </s>
<s> Most of them are pervaded by a brooding spirit of melancholy of the 'moping' rather than the 'musical' sort, and consequently rather ineffective as an artistic motive </s>
<s> Students of Shelley occasionally scan those pages with a view to pick some obscure 'hints and indirections', some veiled reminiscences, in the stories of the adventures and misfortunes of _The Last Man_ or _Lodore_ </s>
<s> And the books may be good biography at times--they are never life </s>
<s> Altogether there is a curious contrast between the two aspects, hitherto revealed, of Mary Shelley's literary activities </s>
<s> It is as if the pulse which had been beating so wildly, so frantically, in _Frankenstein_ (1818), had lapsed, with _Valperga_ (1823) and the rest, into an increasingly sluggish flow </s>
<s> The following pages may be held to bridge the gap between those two extremes in a felicitous way </s>
<s> A more purely artistic mood, instinct with the serene joy and clear warmth of Italian skies, combining a good deal of youthful buoyancy with a sort of quiet and unpretending philosophy, is here represented </s>
<s> And it is submitted that the little classical fancies which Mrs Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works </s>
<s> For one thing they give us the longest poetical effort of the writer </s>
<s> The moon of _Epipsychidion_ never seems to have been thrilled with the music of the highest spheres </s>
<s> Yet there were times when Shelley's inspiration and example fired her into something more than her usual calm and cold brilliancy </s>
<s> One of those periods--perhaps the happiest period in Mary's life--was during the early months in Italy of the English 'exiles' </s>
<s> 'She never was more strongly impelled to write than at this time; she felt her powers fresh and strong within her; all she wanted was some motive, some suggestion to guide her in the choice of a subject' </s>
<s> [Footnote: Mrs Marshall, _The Life and Letters of Mary W </s>
<s> Shelley_, i </s>
<s> 216.] Shelley then expected her to try her hand at a drama, perhaps on the terrible story of the Cenci, or again on the catastrophes of Charles the First </s>
<s> Her _Frankenstein_ was attracting more attention than had ever been granted to his own works </s>
<s> And Shelley, with that touching simplicity which characterized his loving moments, showed the greatest confidence in the literary career of his wife </s>
<s> He helped her and encouraged her in every way </s>
<s> He then translated for her Plato's _Symposium_ </s>
<s> He led her on in her Latin and Italian studies </s>
<s> He wanted her--probably as a sort of preliminary exercise before her flight into tragedy--to translate Alfieri's _Myrrha_ </s>
<s> 'Remember _Charles the First_, and do you be prepared to bring at least some of _Myrrha_ translated,' he wrote; 'remember, remember _Charles the First_ and _Myrrha_,' he insisted; and he quoted, for her benefit, the presumptuous aphorism of Godwin, in _St </s>
<s> Leon_, 'There is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute' </s>
<s> [Footnote: Letter from Padua, 22 September 1818.] But in the year that followed these auspicious days, the strain and stress of her life proved more powerful on Mary Shelley than the inspiration of literature </s>
<s> The loss of her little girl Clara, at Venice, on the 24th of September 1818, was cruel enough </s>
<s> However, she tried hard not to show the 'pusillanimous disposition' which, Godwin assured his daughter, characterizes the persons 'that sink long under a calamity of this nature' </s>
<s> [Footnote: 27 October 1818] But the death of her boy, William, at Rome, on the 4th of June 1819, reduced her to a 'kind of despair' </s>
<s> Whatever it could be to her husband, Italy no longer was for her a 'paradise of exiles' </s>
<s> The flush and excitement of the early months, the 'first fine careless rapture', were for ever gone </s>
<s> 'I shall never recover that blow,' Mary wrote on the 27th of June 1819; 'the thought never leaves me for a single moment; everything on earth has lost its interest for me,' This time her imperturbable father 'philosophized' in vain </s>
<s> With a more sympathetic and acuter intelligence of her case, Leigh Hunt insisted (July 1819) that she should try and give her paralysing sorrow some literary expression, 'strike her pen into some.. </s>
<s> genial subject.. </s>
<s> and bring up a fountain of gentle tears for us' </s>
<s> But the poor childless mother could only rehearse her complaint--'to have won, and thus cruelly to have lost' (4 August 1819) </s>
<s> In fact she had, on William's death, discontinued her diary </s>
<s> Yet on the date just mentioned, as Shelley reached his twenty-seven years, she plucked up courage and resumed the task </s>
<s> Shelley, however absorbed by the creative ardour of his _Annus mirabilis_, could not but observe that his wife's 'spirits continued wretchedly depressed' (5 August 1819); and though masculine enough to resent the fact at times more than pity it, he was human enough to persevere in that habit of co-operative reading and writing which is one of the finest traits of his married life </s>
<s> 'I write in the morning,' his wife testifies, 'read Latin till 2, when we dine; then I read some English book, and two cantos of Dante with Shelley [Footnote: Letter to Mrs Hunt, 28 August 1819.]--a fair average, no doubt, of the homely aspect of the great days which produced _The Cenci_ and _Prometheus_ </s>
<s> On the 12th November, in Florence, the birth of a second son, Percy Florence Shelley, helped Mary out of her sense of bereavement </s>
<s> Subsequent letters still occasionally admit 'low spirits' </s>
<s> But the entries in the Journal make it clear that the year 1819-20 was one of the most pleasantly industrious of her life </s>
<s> Not Dante only, but a motley series of books, great and small, ancient and modern, English and foreign, bespoke her attention </s>
<s> Not content with Latin, and the extemporized translations which Shelley could give her of Plato's _Republic_, she started Greek in 1820, and soon came to delight in it </s>
<s> And again she thought of original composition </s>
<s> 'Write', 'work,'--the words now occur daily in her Journal </s>
<s> These must mainly refer to the long historical novel, which she had planned, as early as 1819, [Footnote: She had 'thought of it' at Marlow, as appears from her letter to Mrs Gisborne, 30 June 1821 (in Mrs Marshall, i </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> 291); but the materials for it were not found before the stay at Naples, and it was not actually begun 'till a year afterwards, at Pisa' (ibid.).] under the title of _Castruccio_, _Prince of Lucca_, and which was not published until 1823, as _Valperga_ </s>
<s> It was indeed a laborious task </s>
<s> The novel 'illustrative of the manners of the Middle Ages in Italy' had to be 'raked out of fifty old books', as Shelley said </s>
<s> [Footnote: Letter to T </s>
<s> L </s>
<s> Peacock, November 1820.] But heavy as the undertaking must have been, it certainly did not engross all the activities of Shelley's wife in this period </s>
<s> And it seems highly probable that the two little mythological dramas which we here publish belong to this same year 1820 </s>
<s> The evidence for this date is as follows </s>
<s> Shelley's lyrics, which these dramas include, were published by his wife (_Posthumous Poems_, 1824) among the 'poems written in 1820' </s>
<s> Another composition, in blank verse, curiously similar to Mary's own work, entitled _Orpheus_, has been allotted by Dr </s>
<s> Garnett (_Relics of Shelley_, 1862) to the same category </s>
<s> [Footnote: Dr </s>
<s> Garnett, in his prefatory note, states that Orpheus 'exists only in a transcript by Mrs Shelley, who has written in playful allusion to her toils as amanuensis _Aspetto fin che il diluvio cala, ed allora cerco di posare argine alle sue parole_' </s>
<s> The poem is thus supposed to have been Shelley's attempt at improvisation, if not indeed a translation from the Italian of the 'improvvisatore' Sgricci </s>
<s> The Shelleys do not seem to have come to know and hear Sgricci before the end of December 1820 </s>
<s> The Italian note after all has no very clear import </s>
<s> And Dr </s>
<s> Garnett in 1905 inclined to the view that _Orpheus_ was the work not of Shelley, but of his wife </s>
<s> A comparison of that fragment and the dramas here published seems to me to suggest the same conclusion, though in both cases Mary Shelley must have been helped by her husband.] Again, it may well be more than a coincidence, that the Proserpine motive occurs in that passage from Dante's _Purgatorio_, canto 28, on 'Matilda gathering flowers', which Shelley is known to have translated shortly before Medwin's visit in the late autumn of 1820 </s>
<s> O come, that I may hear Thy song: like Proserpine, in Enna's glen, Thou seemest to my fancy,--singing here, And gathering flowers, as that fair maiden, when She lost the spring and Ceres her more dear </s>
<s> [Footnote: As published by Medwin, 1834 and 1847.] But we have a far more important, because a direct, testimony in a manuscript addition made by Thomas Medwin in the margin of a copy of his _Life of Shelley_ (1847) </s>
<s> [Footnote: The copy, 2 vols., was sold at Sotheby's on the 6th December 1906: Mr H </s>
<s> Buxton Forman (who was, I think, the buyer) published the contents in _The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, By Thomas Medwin, A New Edition printed from a copy copiously amended and extended by the Author_ </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> Milford, 1913 </s>
<s> The passage here quoted appears on p </s>
<s> 27 of the 2nd vol </s>
<s> of the 1847 edition (Forman ed., p </s>
<s> 252)] The passage is clearly intended--though chronology is no more than any other exact science the 'forte' of that most tantalizing of biographers--to refer to the year 1820 </s>
<s> 'Mrs Shelley had at this time been writing some little Dramas on classical subjects, one of which was the Rape of Proserpine, a very graceful composition which she has never published </s>
<s> Shelley contributed to this the exquisite fable of Arethusa and the Invocation to Ceres.--Among the Nymphs gathering flowers on Enna were two whom she called Ino and Uno, names which I remember in the Dialogue were irresistibly ludicrous </s>
<s> She also wrote one on Midas, into which were introduced by Shelley, in the Contest between Pan and Apollo, the Sublime Effusion of the latter, and Pan's characterised Ode' </s>
<s> This statement of Medwin finally settles the question </s>
<s> The 'friend' at whose request, Mrs Shelley says, [Footnote: The Hymns of Pan and Apollo were first published by Mrs Shelley in _the Posthumous Poems_, 1824, with a note saying that they had been 'written at the request of a friend to be inserted in a drama on the subject of Midas' </s>
<s> _Arethusa_ appeared in the same volume, dated 'Pisa, 1820' </s>
<s> Proserpine's song was not published before the first collected edition of 1839.] the lyrics were written by her husband, was herself </s>
<s> And she was the author of the dramas </s>
<s> [Footnote: Not E </s>
<s> E </s>
<s> Williams (Buxton Forman, ed </s>
<s> 1882, vol </s>
<s> iv, p </s>
<s> 34) </s>
<s> The manuscript of the poetical play composed about 1822 by the latter, 'The Promise', with Shelley's autograph poem ('Night </s>
<s> with all thine eyes look down'), was given to the Bodleian Library in 1914.] The manuscript (Bodleian Library, MS </s>
<s> Shelley, d </s>
<s> 2) looks like a cheap exercise-book, originally of 40, now of 36 leaves, 8 1/4 x 6 inches, in boards </s>
<s> The contents are the dramas here presented, written in a clear legible hand--the equable hand of Mrs Shelley </s>
<s> [Footnote: Shelley's lyrics are also in his wife's writing--Mr Locock is surely mistaken in assuming two different hands to this manuscript (_The Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley_, Methuen, 1909, vol </s>
<s> iii, p </s>
<s> xix).] There are very few words corrected or cancelled </s>
<s> It is obviously a fair copy </s>
<s> Mr C </s>
<s> D </s>
<s> Locock, in his _Examination of the Shelley Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library_ (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1903, pp </s>
<s> 24-25), has already pointed out the valuable emendations of the 'received' text of Shelley's lyrics which are found here </s>
<s> In fact the only mystery is why neither Shelley, nor Mary in the course of her long widowed years, should have published these curious, and surely not contemptible, by-products of their co-operation in the fruitful year 1820 </s>
<s> II </s>
<s> For indeed there is more than a personal interest attached to these writings of Mrs Shelley's </s>
<s> The fact that the same mind which had revelled, a few years earlier, in the fantastical horrors of Frankenstein's abortive creation, could now dwell on the melancholy fate of Proserpine or the humorous disappointment of Midas, and delight in their subtle poetical or moral symbolism--this fact has its significance </s>
<s> It is one of the earliest indications of the revival, in the heart of Romanticism, of the old love of classical myths and classical beauty </s>
<s> The subject is a wide one, and cannot be adequately dealt with in this place </s>
<s> But a few words may not be superfluous for a correct historical appreciation of Mrs Shelley's attempt </s>
<s> How deficient had been the sense of classical beauty in the so-called classical age of English literature, is a trite consideration of criticism </s>
<s> The treatment of mythology is particularly conclusive on this point </s>
<s> Throughout the 'Augustan' era, mythology was approached as a mere treasure-house of pleasant fancies, artificial decorations, 'motives', whether sumptuous or meretricious </s>
<s> Allusions to Jove and Venus, Mercury, Apollo, or Bacchus, are of course found in every other page of Dryden, Pope, Prior, Swift, Gay, and Parnell </s>
<s> But no fresh presentation, no loving interpretation, of the old myths occur anywhere </s>
<s> The immortal stories were then part and parcel of a sort of poetical curriculum through which the whole school must be taken by the stern masters Tradition and Propriety </s>
<s> There is little to be wondered at, if this matter of curriculum was treated by the more passive scholars as a matter of course, and by the sharper and less reverent disciples as a matter of fun </s>
<s> Indeed, if any personality is then evinced in the adaptation of these old world themes, it is generally connected with a more or less emphatic disparagement or grotesque distortion of their real meaning </s>
<s> When Dryden, for example, makes use of the legend of Midas, in his _Wife of Bath's Tale_, he makes, not Midas's minister, but his queen, tell the mighty secret--and thus secures another hit at woman's loquacity </s>
<s> Prior's _Female Phaeton_ is a younger sister, who, jealous of her elder's success, thus pleads with her 'mamma': I'll have my earl as well as she Or know the reason why </s>
<s> And she wants to flaunt it accordingly </s>
<s> Finally, Fondness prevailed; mamma gave way; Kitty, at heart's desire, Obtained the chariot for a day, And set the world on fire </s>
<s> Pandora, in Parnell's _Hesiod or the Rise of Woman_, is only a 'shining vengeance.. </s>
<s> A pleasing bosom-cheat, a specious ill' sent by the gods upon earth to punish the race of Prometheus </s>
<s> The most poetical fables of Greece are desecrated by Gay into mere miniatures for the decoration of his _Fan_ </s>
<s> Similar instances abound later on </s>
<s> When Armstrong brings in an apostrophe to the Naiads, it is in the course of a _Poetical Essay on the Art of Preserving Health_ </s>
<s> And again, when Cowper stirs himself to intone an _Ode to Apollo_, it is in the same mock-heroic vein: Patron of all those luckless brains, That to the wrong side leaning Indite much metre with much pains And little or no meaning.. </s>
<s> Even in Gray's--'Pindaric Gray's'--treatment of classical themes, there is a sort of pervading _ennui_, or the forced appreciativeness of a gouty, disappointed man </s>
<s> The daughter of Jove to whom he dedicates his hymns too often is 'Adversity' </s>
<s> And classical reminiscences have, even with him, a dull musty tinge which recalls the antiquarian in his Cambridge college-rooms rather than the visitor to Florence and Rome </s>
<s> For one thing, his allusions are too many, and too transitory, to appear anything but artistic tricks and verse- making tools </s>
<s> The 'Aegean deep', and 'Delphi's steep', and 'Meander's amber waves', and the 'rosy-crowned Loves', are too cursorily summoned, and dismissed, to suggest that they have been brought in for their own sweet sakes </s>
<s> It was thus with all the fine quintessences of ancient lore, with all the pearl-like accretions of the faiths and fancies of the old world: they were handled about freely as a kind of curious but not so very rare coins, which found no currency in the deeper thoughts of our modern humanity, and could therefore be used as a mere badge of the learning and taste of a literary 'coterie' </s>
<s> The very names of the ancient gods and heroes were in fact assuming that abstract anaemic look which common nouns have in everyday language </s>
<s> Thus, when Garrick, in his verses _Upon a Lady's Embroidery_, mentions 'Arachne', it is obvious that he does not expect the reader to think of the daring challenger of Minerva's art, or the Princess of Lydia, but just of a plain spider </s>
<s> And again, when Falconer, in his early _Monody on the death of the Prince of Wales_, expresses a rhetorical wish 'to aid hoarse howling Boreas with his sighs,' that particular son of Astraeus, whose love for the nymph Orithyia was long unsuccessful, because he could not 'sigh', is surely far from the poet's mind; and 'to swell the wind', or 'the gale', would have served his turn quite as well, though less 'elegantly' </s>
<s> Even Gibbon, with all his partiality for whatever was pre- or post- Christian, had indeed no better word than 'elegant' for the ancient mythologies of Greece and Rome, and he surely reflected no particularly advanced opinion when he praised and damned, in one breath, 'the pleasant and absurd system of Paganism' </s>
<s> [Footnote: Essay on the Study of Literature, Section 56.] No wonder if in his days, and for a long time after, the passionate giants of the Ages of Fable had dwindled down to the pretty puppets with which the daughters of the gentry had to while away many a school hour </s>
<s> But the days of this rhetorical--or satirical, didactic--or perfunctory, treatment of classical themes were doomed </s>
<s> It is the glory of Romanticism to have opened 'magic casements' not only on 'the foam of perilous seas' in the West, but also on the chambers of the East, The chambers of the Sun, that now From ancient melody had ceased </s>
<s> [Footnote: Blake, _Poetical Sketches_, 1783.] Romanticism, as a freshening up of all the sources of life, a general rejuvenescence of the soul, a ubiquitous visiting of the spirit of delight and wonder, could not confine itself to the fields of mediaeval romance </s>
<s> Even the records of the Greek and Roman thought assumed a new beauty; the classical sense was let free from its antiquarian trammels, and the perennial fanes resounded to the songs of a more impassioned worship </s>
<s> The change, however, took some time </s>
<s> And it must be admitted that in England, especially, the Romantic movement was slow to go back to classical themes </s>
<s> Winckelmann and Goethe, and Chenier--the last, indeed, practically all unknown to his contemporaries--had long rediscovered Antiquity, and felt its pulse anew, and praised its enduring power, when English poetry had little, if anything, to show in answer to the plaintive invocation of Blake to the Ancient Muses </s>
<s> The first generation of English Romantics either shunned the subject altogether, or simply echoed Blake's isolated lines in isolated passages as regretful and almost as despondent </s>
<s> From Persia to Paraguay Southey could wander and seek after exotic themes; his days could be 'passed among the dead'--but neither the classic lands nor the classic heroes ever seem to have detained him </s>
<s> Walter Scott's 'sphere of sensation may be almost exactly limited by the growth of heather', as Ruskin says; [Footnote: _Modern Painters_, iii </s>
<s> 317] and when he came to Rome, his last illness prevented him from any attempt he might have wished to make to enlarge his field of vision </s>
<s> Wordsworth was even less far-travelled, and his home-made poetry never thought of the 'Pagan' and his 'creed outworn', but as a distinct _pis-aller_ in the way of inspiration </s>
<s> [Footnote: _Sonnet_ 'The world is too much with us'; cf </s>
<s> _The Excursion_, iv </s>
<s> 851-57.] And again, though Coleridge has a few magnificent lines about them, he seems to have even less willingly than Wordsworth hearkened after The intelligible forms of ancient poets, The fair humanities of old religion </s>
<s> [Footnote: _The Piccolomini_, II, iv.] It was to be otherwise with the later English Romantic poets </s>
<s> They lived and worked at a time when the whole atmosphere and even the paraphernalia of literary composition had just undergone a considerable change </s>
<s> After a period of comparative seclusion and self- concentration, England at the Peace of Amiens once more found its way to Europe--and vice versa </s>
<s> And from our point of view this widening of prospects is especially noticeable </s>
<s> For the classical revival in Romanticism appears to be closely connected with it </s>
<s> It is an alluring subject to investigate </s>
<s> How the progress of scholarship, the recent 'finds' of archaeology, the extension of travelling along Mediterranean shores, the political enthusiasms evoked by the stirrings of young Italy and young Greece, all combined to reawaken in the poetical imagination of the times the dormant memories of antiquity has not yet been told by the historians of literature </s>
<s> [Footnote: At least as far as England is concerned </s>
<s> For France, cf </s>
<s> Canat, _La renaissance de la Grece antique_, Hachette, Paris, 1911.] But--and this is sufficient for our purpose--every one knows what the Elgin Marbles have done for Keats and Shelley; and what inspirations were derived from their pilgrimages in classic lands by all the poets of this and the following generation, from Byron to Landor </s>
<s> Such experiences could not but react on the common conception of mythology </s>
<s> A knowledge of the great classical sculpture of Greece could not but invest with a new dignity and chastity the notions which so far had been nurtured on the Venus de' Medici and the Belvedere Apollo--even Shelley lived and possibly died under their spell </s>
<s> And 'returning to the nature which had inspired the ancient myths', the Romantic poets must have felt with a keener sense 'their exquisite vitality' </s>
<s> [Footnote: J </s>
<s> A, Symonds, _Studies of the Greek Poets_, ii, p </s>
<s> 258.] The whole tenor of English Romanticism may be said to have been affected thereby </s>
<s> For English Romanticism--and this is one of its most distinctive merits--had no exclusiveness about it </s>
<s> It was too spontaneous, one would almost say, too unconscious, ever to be clannish </s>
<s> It grew, untrammelled by codes, uncrystallized into formulas, a living thing always, not a subject-matter for grandiloquent manifestoes and more or less dignified squabbles </s>
<s> It could therefore absorb and turn to account elements which seemed antagonistic to it in the more sophisticated forms it assumed in other literatures </s>
<s> Thus, whilst French Romanticism--in spite of what it may or may not have owed to Chenier--became often distinctly, deliberately, wilfully anti- classical, whilst for example [Footnote: As pointed out by Brunetiere, _Evolution de la Poesie lyrique_, ii, p </s>
<s> 147.] Victor Hugo in that all-comprehending _Legende des Siecles_ could find room for the Hegira and for Zim-Zizimi, but did not consecrate a single line to the departed glories of mythical Greece, the Romantic poets of England may claim to have restored in freshness and purity the religion of antiquity </s>
<s> Indeed their voice was so convincing that even the great Christian chorus that broke out afresh in the Victorian era could not entirely drown it, and Elizabeth Barrett had an apologetic way of dismissing 'the dead Pan', and all the 'vain false gods of Hellas', with an acknowledgement of your beauty which confesses Some chief Beauty conquering you </s>
<s> This may be taken to have been the average attitude, in the forties, towards classical mythology </s>
<s> That twenty years before, at least in the Shelley circle, it was far less grudging, we now have definite proof </s>
<s> Not only was Shelley prepared to admit, with the liberal opinion of the time, that ancient mythology 'was a system of nature concealed under the veil of allegory', a system in which 'a thousand fanciful fables contained a secret and mystic meaning': [Footnote: _Edinb </s>
<s> Rev._, July 1808.] he was prepared to go a considerable step farther, and claim that there was no essential difference between ancient mythology and the theology of the Christians, that both were interpretations, in more or less figurative language, of the great mysteries of being, and indeed that the earlier interpretation, precisely because it was more frankly figurative and poetical than the later one, was better fitted to stimulate and to allay the sense of wonder which ought to accompany a reverent and high-souled man throughout his life-career </s>
<s> In the earlier phase of Shelley's thought, this identification of the ancient and the modern faiths was derogatory to both </s>
<s> The letter which he had written in 1812 for the edification of Lord Ellenborough revelled in the contemplation of a time 'when the Christian religion shall have faded from the earth, when its memory like that of Polytheism now shall remain, but remain only as the subject of ridicule and wonder' </s>
<s> But as time went on, Shelley's views became less purely negative </s>
<s> Instead of ruling the adversaries back to back out of court, he bethought himself of venturing a plea in favour of the older and weaker one </s>
<s> It may have been in 1817 that he contemplated an 'Essay in favour of polytheism'.[Footnote: Cf </s>
<s> our _Shelley's Prose in the Bodleian MSS_., 1910, p </s>
<s> 124.] He was then living on the fringe of a charmed circle of amateur and adventurous Hellenists who could have furthered the scheme </s>
<s> His great friend, Thomas Love Peacock, 'Greeky Peaky', was a personal acquaintance of Thomas Taylor 'the Platonist', alias 'Pagan Taylor' </s>
<s> And Taylor's translations and commentaries of Plato had been favourites of Shelley in his college days </s>
<s> Something at least of Taylor's queer mixture of flaming enthusiasm and tortuous ingenuity may be said to appear in the unexpected document we have now to examine </s>

<s> But we have enough to understand the general trend of the argument </s>
<s> It did not actually intend to sap the foundations of Scriptural authority </s>
<s> But it was bold enough to risk a little shaking in order to prove that the Sacred Books of the Greeks and Romans did not, after all, present us with a much more rickety structure </s>
<s> This was a task of conciliation rather than destruction </s>
<s> And yet even this conservative view of the Shelleys' exegesis cannot--and will not-- detract from the value of the above document </s>
<s> Surely, this curious theory of the equal 'inspiration' of Polytheism and the Jewish or Christian religions, whether it was invented or simply espoused by Mrs Shelley, evinces in her--for the time being at least--a very considerable share of that adventurous if somewhat uncritical alacrity of mind which carried the poet through so many religious and political problems </s>
<s> It certainly vindicates her, more completely perhaps than anything hitherto published, against the strictures of those who knew her chiefly or exclusively in later years, and could speak of her as a 'most conventional slave', who 'even affected the pious dodge', and 'was not a suitable companion for the poet' </s>

<s> e </s>
<s> ed </s>
<s> H </s>
<s> Buxton Forman, p </s>
<s> 253.] and 'whose arguments she then thought irrefutable--_tempora mutantur!_' However that may be, the two little mythological dramas on _Proserpine_ and _Midas_ assume, in the light of that enthusiasm, a special interest </s>
<s> They stand--or fall--both as a literary, and to a certain extent as an intellectual effort </s>
<s> They are more than an attitude, and not much less than an avowal </s>
<s> Not only do they claim our attention as the single poetical work of any length which seems to have been undertaken by Mrs Shelley; they are a unique and touching monument of that intimate co-operation which at times, especially in the early years in Italy, could make the union of 'the May' and 'the Elf' almost unreservedly delightful </s>
<s> It would undoubtedly be fatuous exaggeration to ascribe a very high place in literature to these little Ovidian fancies of Mrs Shelley </s>
<s> The scenes, after all, are little better than adaptations--fairly close adaptations--of the Latin poet's well-known tales </s>
<s> Even _Proserpine_, though clearly the more successful of the two, both more strongly knit as drama, and less uneven in style and versification, cannot for a moment compare with the far more original interpretations of Tennyson, Swinburne, or Meredith </s>
<s> [Footnote: _Demeter and Persephone_, 1889; _The Garden of Proserpine_, 1866; _The Appeasement of Demeter_, 1888.] But it is hardly fair to draw in the great names of the latter part of the century </s>
<s> The parallel would be more illuminating--and the final award passed on Mrs Shelley's attempt more favourable--if we were to think of a contemporary production like 'Barry Cornwall's' _Rape of Proserpine_, which, being published in 1820, it is just possible that the Shelleys should have known </s>
<s> B </s>
<s> W </s>
<s> Procter's poem is also a dramatic 'scene', written 'in imitation of the mode originated by the Greek Tragic Writers' </s>
<s> In fact those hallowed models seem to have left far fewer traces in Barry Cornwall's verse than the Alexandrian--or pseudo-Alexandrian-- tradition of meretricious graces and coquettish fancies, which the eighteenth century had already run to death </s>
<s> [Footnote: To adduce an example--in what is probably not an easily accessible book to-day: Proserpine, distributing her flowers, thus addresses one of her nymphs: For this lily, Where can it hang but at Cyane's breast </s>
<s> And yet 'twill wither on so white a bed, If flowers have sense for envy.] And, more damnable still, the poetical essence of the legend, the identification of Proserpine's twofold existence with the grand alternation of nature's seasons, has been entirely neglected by the author </s>
<s> Surely his work, though published, is quite as deservedly obscure as Mrs Shelley's derelict manuscript </s>
<s> _Midas_ has the privilege, if it be one, of not challenging any obvious comparison </s>
<s> The subject, since Lyly's and Dryden's days, has hardly attracted the attention of the poets </s>
<s> It was so eminently fit for the lighter kinds of presentation that the agile bibliographer who aimed at completeness would have to go through a fairly long list of masques, [Footnote: There is one by poor Christopher Smart.] comic operas, or 'burlettas', all dealing with the ludicrous misfortunes of the Phrygian king </s>
<s> But an examination of these would be sheer pedantry in this place </s>
<s> Here again Mrs Shelley has stuck to her Latin source as closely as she could </s>
<s> [Footnote: Perhaps her somewhat wearying second act, on the effects of the gold-transmuting gift, would have been shorter, if Ovid (_Metam._ xi </s>
<s> 108-30) had not himself gone into such details on the subject.] She has made a gallant attempt to connect the two stories with which Midas has ever since Ovid's days been associated, and a distinct--indeed a too perceptible--effort to press out a moral meaning in this, as she had easily extricated a cosmological meaning in the other tale </s>
<s> Perhaps we have said too much to introduce these two little unpretending poetical dramas </s>
<s> They might indeed have been allowed to speak for themselves </s>
<s> A new frame often makes a new face; and some of the best known and most exquisite of Shelley's lyrics, when restored to the surroundings for which the poet intended them, needed no other set-off to appeal to the reader with a fresh charm of quiet classical grace and beauty </s>
<s> But the charm will operate all the more unfailingly, if we remember that this clear classical mood was by no means such a common element in the literary atmosphere of the times--not even a permanent element in the authors' lives </s>
<s> We have here none of the feverish ecstasy that lifts _Prometheus_ and _Hellas_ far above the ordinary range of philosophical or political poetry </s>
<s> But Shelley's encouragement, probably his guidance and supervision, have raised his wife's inspiration to a place considerably higher than that of _Frankenstein_ or _Valperga_ </s>

<s> _Scene; a rural spot; on one side, a bare Hill, on the other an Ilex wood; a stream with reeds on its banks._ _The Curtain rises and discovers Tmolus seated on a throne of turf, on his right hand Apollo with his lyre, attended by the Muses; on the left, Pan, fauns, &c._ _Enter Midas and Zopyrion._ _Midas._ The Hours have oped the palace of the dawn And through the Eastern gates of Heaven, Aurora Comes charioted on light, her wind-swift steeds, Winged with roseate clouds, strain up the steep </s>
<s> She loosely holds the reins, her golden hair, Its strings outspread by the sweet morning breeze[,] Blinds the pale stars </s>
<s> Our rural tasks begin; The young lambs bleat pent up within the fold, The herds low in their stalls, & the blithe cock Halloos most loudly to his distant mates </s>
<s> But who are these we see </s>
<s> these are not men, Divine of form & sple[n]didly arrayed, They sit in solemn conclave </s>
<s> Is that Pan, [36] Our Country God, surrounded by his Fauns </s>

<s> _Zopyr._ Best Your majesty retire; we may offend </s>
<s> _Midas._ Aye, and at the base thought the coward blood Deserts your trembling lips; but follow me </s>
<s> Oh Gods </s>

<s> [Sidenote: (Shelley.)] _Apollo (sings)._ The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie, Curtained with star-enwoven tapestries, From the broad moonlight of the sky, Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes Waken me when their Mother, the grey Dawn, Tells them that dreams & that the moon is gone </s>
<s> Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome, I walk over the mountains & the waves, Leaving my robe upon the Ocean foam,-- My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves Are filled with my bright presence & the air Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare </s>

<s> I stand at noon upon the peak of heaven, Then with unwilling steps I wander down Into the clouds of the Atlantic even-- For grief that I depart they weep & frown [;] What look is more delightful than the smile With which I soothe them from the western isle [?] I am the eye with which the Universe Beholds itself & knows it is divine </s>

<s> _Scene; a splendid apartment in the Palace of Midas._ _Enter Midas (with a golden rose in his hand)._ _Mid._ Gold </s>
<s> glorious gold </s>
<s> I am made up of gold </s>
<s> I pluck a rose, a silly, fading rose, Its soft, pink petals change to yellow gold; Its stem, its leaves are gold--and what before Was fit for a poor peasant's festal dress May now adorn a Queen </s>
<s> I lift a stone, A heavy, useless mass, a slave would spurn, What is more valueless </s>
<s> 'Tis solid gold </s>
<s> A king might war on me to win the same </s>
<s> And as I pass my hand thus through the air, A little shower of sightless dust falls down A shower of gold </s>
<s> O, now I am a king </s>
<s> I've spread my hands against my palace walls, I've set high ladders up, that I may touch Each crevice and each cornice with my hands, And it will all be gold:--a golden palace, Surrounded by a wood of golden trees, Which will bear golden fruits.--The very ground My naked foot treads on is yellow gold, Invaluable gold </s>
<s> my dress is gold </s>
<s> [53] Now I am great </s>
<s> Innumerable armies Wait till my gold collects them round my throne; I see my standard made of woven gold </s>
<s> Waving o'er Asia's utmost Citadels, Guarded by myriads invincible </s>
<s> Or if the toil of war grows wearisome, I can buy Empires:--India shall be mine, Its blooming beauties, gold-encrusted baths, Its aromatic groves and palaces, All will be mine </s>
<s> Oh, Midas, ass-eared king </s>
<s> I love thee more than any words can tell, That thus thy touch, thou man akin to Gods, Can change all earth to heaven,--Olympian gold </s>
<s> For what makes heaven different from earth </s>
<s> Look how my courtiers come </s>
<s> Magnificent </s>
<s> None shall dare wait on me but those who bear An empire on their backs in sheets of gold </s>
<s> Oh, what a slave I was </s>
<s> my flocks & kine, My vineyards & my corn were all my wealth And men esteemed me rich; but now Great Jove Transcends me but by lightning, and who knows If my gold win not the Cyclopean Powers, And Vulcan, who must hate his father's rule, To forge me bolts?--and then--but hush </s>
<s> they come </s>
<s> [54] _Enter Zopyrion, Asphalion, & Lacon._ _Lac._ Pardon us, mighty king-- _Mid._ What would ye, slaves </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> I could buy you all with one slight touch Of my gold-making hand </s>
<s> _Asph._ Royal Midas, We humbly would petition for relief </s>
<s> _Mid._ Relief I Bring me your copper coin, your brass, Or what ye will--ye'll speedily be rich </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ 'Tis not for gold, but to be rid of gold, That we intrude upon your Majesty </s>
<s> I fear that you will suffer by this gift, As we do now </s>
<s> Look at our backs bent down With the huge weight of the great cloaks of gold </s>
<s> Permit us to put on our shabby dress, Our poor despised garments of light wool:-- We walk as porters underneath a load </s>
<s> Pity, great king, our human weaknesses, Nor force us to expire-- _Mid._ Begone, ye slaves </s>
<s> Go clothe your wretched limbs in ragged skins </s>
<s> Take an old carpet to wrap round your legs, A broad leaf for your feet--ye shall not wear [55] That dress--those golden sandals--monarch like </s>
<s> _Asph._ If you would have us walk a mile a day We cannot thus--already we are tired With the huge weight of soles of solid gold </s>
<s> _Mid._ Pitiful wretches </s>
<s> Earth-born, groveling dolts </s>
<s> Begone </s>
<s> nor dare reply to my just wrath </s>
<s> Never behold me more </s>
<s> or if you stay Let not a sigh, a shrug, a stoop betray What poor, weak, miserable men you are </s>
<s> Not as I--I am a God </s>
<s> Look, dunce </s>
<s> I tread or leap beneath this load of gold </s>
<s> (_Jumps & stops suddenly._) I've hurt my back:--this cloak is wondrous hard </s>
<s> No more of this </s>
<s> my appetite would say The hour is come for my noon-day repast </s>
<s> _Lac._ It comes borne in by twenty lusty slaves, Who scarce can lift the mass of solid gold, That lately was a table of light wood </s>
<s> Here is the heavy golden ewer & bowl, In which, before you eat, you wash your hands </s>
<s> _Mid._ (_lifting up the ewer_) This is to be a king </s>
<s> to touch pure gold </s>
<s> Would that by touching thee, Zopyrion, [56] I could transmute thee to a golden man; A crowd of golden slaves to wait on me </s>
<s> (_Pours the water on his hands._) But how is this </s>
<s> the water that I touch Falls down a stream of yellow liquid gold, And hardens as it falls </s>
<s> I cannot wash-- Pray Bacchus, I may drink </s>
<s> and the soft towel With which I'd wipe my hands transmutes itself Into a sheet of heavy gold.--No more </s>
<s> I'll sit and eat:--I have not tasted food For many hours, I have been so wrapt In golden dreams of all that I possess, I had not time to eat; now hunger calls And makes me feel, though not remote in power From the immortal Gods, that I need food, The only remnant of mortality </s>
<s> (_In vain attempts to eat of several dishes._) Alas </s>
<s> my fate </s>
<s> 'tis gold </s>
<s> this peach is gold </s>
<s> This bread, these grapes & all I touch </s>
<s> this meat Which by its scent quickened my appetite Has lost its scent, its taste,--'tis useless gold </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ (_aside_) He'd better now have followed my advice </s>
<s> He starves by gold yet keeps his asses' ears </s>
<s> [57] _Mid._ Asphalion, put that apple to my mouth; If my hands touch it not perhaps I eat </s>
<s> Alas </s>
<s> I cannot bite </s>
<s> as it approached I felt its fragrance, thought it would be mine, But by the touch of my life-killing lips 'Tis changed from a sweet fruit to tasteless gold, Bacchus will not refresh me by his gifts, The liquid wine congeals and flies my taste </s>
<s> Go, miserable slaves </s>
<s> Oh, wretched king </s>
<s> Away with food </s>
<s> Its sight now makes me sick </s>
<s> Bring in my couch </s>
<s> I will sleep off my care, And when I wake I'll coin some remedy </s>
<s> I dare not bathe this sultry day, for fear I be enclosed in gold </s>
<s> Begone </s>
<s> I will to rest:--oh, miserable king </s>
<s> (_Exeunt all but Midas </s>
<s> He lies down, turns restlessly for some time & then rises._) Oh </s>
<s> fool </s>
<s> to wish to change all things to gold </s>
<s> Blind Ideot that I was </s>
<s> This bed is gold; And this hard, weighty pillow, late so soft, That of itself invited me to rest, Is a hard lump, that if I sleep and turn I may beat out my brains against its sides </s>
<s> [58] Oh </s>
<s> what a wretched thing I am </s>
<s> how blind </s>
<s> I cannot eat, for all my food is gold; Drink flies my parched lips, and my hard couch Is worse than rock to my poor bruised sides </s>
<s> I cannot walk; the weight of my gold soles Pulls me to earth:--my back is broke beneath These gorgeous garments--(_throws off his cloak_) Lie there, golden cloak </s>
<s> There on thy kindred earth, lie there and rot </s>
<s> I dare not touch my forehead with my palm For fear my very flesh should turn to gold </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> let me curse thee, vilest, yellow dirt </s>
<s> Here, on my knees, thy martyr lifts his voice, A poor, starved wretch who can touch nought but thee[,] Wilt thou refresh me in the heat of noon </s>
<s> Canst thou be kindled for me when I'm cold </s>
<s> May all men, & the immortal Gods, Hate & spurn thee as wretched I do now </s>
<s> (_Kicks the couch, & tries to throw down the pillow but cannot lift it._) I'd dash, thee to the earth, but that thy weight Preserves thee, abhorred, Tartarian Gold </s>
<s> [59] Bacchus, O pity, pardon, and restore me </s>
<s> Who waits </s>
<s> _Enter Lacon._ Go bid the priests that they prepare Most solemn song and richest sacrifise;-- Which I may not dare touch, lest it should turn To most unholy gold </s>
<s> _Lacon._ Pardon me, oh King, But perhaps the God may give that you may eat, And yet your touch be magic </s>
<s> _Mid._ No more, thou slave </s>
<s> Gold is my fear, my bane, my death </s>
<s> I hate Its yellow glare, its aspect hard and cold </s>
<s> I would be rid of all.--Go bid them haste </s>
<s> (_Exit Lacon._) Oh, Bacchus I be propitious to their prayer </s>
<s> Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins-- And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, But take from me the frightful curse of gold </s>
<s> Am I not poor </s>
<s> Alas </s>
<s> how I am changed </s>
<s> Poorer than meanest slaves, my piles of wealth Cannot buy for me one poor, wretched dish:-- In summer heat I cannot bathe, nor wear A linen dress; the heavy, dull, hard metal Clings to me till I pray for poverty </s>
<s> _Enter Zopyrion, Asphalion & Lacon._ [60] _Zopyr._ The sacrifice is made, & the great God, Pitying your ills, oh King, accepted it, Whilst his great oracle gave forth these words </s>
<s> "Let poor king Midas bathe in the clear stream "Of swift Pactolus, & to those waves tran[s]fer "The gold-transmuting power, which he repents" </s>
<s> _Mid._ Oh joy </s>
<s> Oh Bacchus, thanks for this to thee Will I each year offer three sucking lambs-- Games will I institute--nor Pan himself Shall have more honour than thy deity </s>
<s> Haste to the stream,--I long to feel the cool And liquid touch of its divinest waves </s>
<s> (_Exeunt all except Zopyrion and Asphalion._) _Asph._ Off with our golden sandals and our cloaks </s>
<s> Oh, I shall ever hate the sight of gold </s>
<s> Poor, wealthy Midas runs as if from death To rid him quick of this meta[l]lic curse </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ (_aside_) I wonder if his asses['] ears are gold; What would I give to let the secret out </s>
<s> Gold </s>
<s> that is trash, we have too much of it,-- But I would give ten new born lambs to tell This most portentous truth--but I must choke </s>
<s> _Asph._ Now we shall tend our flocks and reap our corn As we were wont, and not be killed by gold </s>
<s> Golden fleeces threatened our poor sheep, [61] The very showers as they fell from heaven Could not refresh the earth; the wind blew gold, And as we walked [Footnote: MS </s>
<s> _as he walked._] the thick sharp-pointed atoms Wounded our faces--the navies would have sunk-- _Zopyr._ All strangers would have fled our gold-cursed shore, Till we had bound our wealthy king, that he Might leave the green and fertile earth unchanged;-- Then in deep misery he would have shook His golden chains & starved </s>
<s> _Enter Lacon._ _Lacon._ Sluggards, how now I Have you not been to gaze upon the sight </s>
<s> To see the noble king cast off the gift Which he erewhile so earnestly did crave[?] _Asph._ I am so tired with the weight of gold I bore to-day I could not budge a foot To see the finest sight Jove could display </s>
<s> But tell us, Lacon, what he did and said </s>
<s> _Lac._ Although he'd fain have run[,] his golden dress And heavy sandals made the poor king limp As leaning upon mine and the high priest's arm, He hastened to Pactolus </s>
<s> When he saw The stream--"Thanks to the Gods" </s>
<s> he cried aloud In joy; then having cast aside his robes He leaped into the waves, and with his palm Throwing the waters high--"This is not gold," [62] He cried, "I'm free, I have got rid of gold" </s>
<s> And then he drank, and seizing with delight A little leaf that floated down the stream, "Thou art not gold," he said-- _Zopyr._ But all this time-- Did you behold?--Did he take off his crown?-- _Lacon._ No:--It was strange to see him as he plunged Hold tight his crown with his left hand the while </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ (_aside_) Alas, my fate </s>
<s> I thought they had been seen </s>
<s> _Lac._ He ordered garments to the river side Of coarsest texture;--those that erst he wore He would not touch, for they were trimmed with gold </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ And yet he did not throw away his crown </s>
<s> _Lac._ He ever held it tight as if he thought Some charm attached to its remaining there </s>
<s> Perhaps he is right;--know you, Zopyrion, If that strange voice this morning spoke the truth </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ Nay guess;--think of what passed & you can judge </s>
<s> I dare not--I know nothing of his ears </s>
<s> _Lac._ I am resolved some night when he sleeps sound To get a peep.--No more,'tis he that comes </s>
<s> He has now lost the boon that Bacchus gave, Having bestowed it on the limpid waves </s>
<s> Now over golden sands Pactolus runs, [63] And as it flows creates a mine of wealth </s>
<s> _Enter Midas, (with grapes in his hand)._ _Mid._ I see again the trees and smell the flowers With colours lovelier than the rainbow's self; I see the gifts of rich-haired Ceres piled And eat </s>
<s> (_holding up the grapes_) This is not yellow, dirty gold, But blooms with precious tints, purple and green </s>
<s> I hate this palace and its golden floor, Its cornices and rafters all of gold:-- I'll build a little bower of freshest green, Canopied o'er with leaves & floored with moss:-- I'll dress in skins;--I'll drink from wooden cups And eat on wooden platters--sleep on flock; None but poor men shall dare attend on me </s>
<s> All that is gold I'll banish from my court, Gilding shall be high treason to my state, The very name of gold shall be crime capital[.] _Zopyr._ May we not keep our coin </s>
<s> _Mid._ No, Zopyrion, None but the meanest peasants shall have gold </s>
<s> It is a sordid, base and dirty thing:-- Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, These are Joves treasures & they are not gold:-- [64] Now they are mine, I am no longer cursed.-- The hapless river hates its golden sands, As it rolls over them, having my gift;-- Poor harmless shores </s>
<s> they now are dirty gold </s>
<s> How I detest it </s>
<s> Do not the Gods hate gold </s>
<s> Nature displays the treasures that she loves, She hides gold deep in the earth & piles above Mountains & rocks to keep the monster down </s>
<s> _Asph._ They say Apollo's sunny car is gold </s>
<s> _Mid._ Aye, so it is for Gold belongs to him:-- But Phoebus is my bitterest enemy, And what pertains to him he makes my bane </s>
<s> _Zopyr._ What [!] will your Majesty tell the world?-- _Mid._ Peace, vile gossip </s>
<s> Asphalion, come you here </s>
<s> Look at those golden columns; those inlaid walls; The ground, the trees, the flowers & precious food That in my madness I did turn to gold:-- Pull it all down, I hate its sight and touch; Heap up my cars & waggons with the load And yoke my kine to drag it to the sea: Then crowned with flowers, ivy & Bacchic vine, And singing hymns to the immortal Gods, We will ascend ships freighted with the gold, [65] And where no plummet's line can sound the depth Of greedy Ocean, we will throw it in, All, all this frightful heap of yellow dirt </s>
<s> Down through the dark, blue waters it will sink, Frightening the green-haired Nereids from their sport And the strange Tritons--the waves will close above And I, thank Bacchus, ne'er shall see it more </s>
<s> And we will make all echoing heaven ring With our loud hymns of thanks, & joyous pour Libations in the deep, and reach the land, Rich, happy, free & great, that we have lost Man's curse, heart-bartering, soul-enchaining gold </s>
<s> FINIS </s>
