<s> Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War </s>
<s> By Herman Melville </s>
<s> 1866 </s>
<s> The Battle-Pieces in this volume are dedicated to the memory of the THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND who in the war for the maintenance of the Union fell devotedly under the flag of their fathers </s>
<s> [With few exceptions, the Pieces in this volume originated in an impulse imparted by the fall of Richmond </s>
<s> They were composed without reference to collective arrangement, but being brought together in review, naturally fall into the order assumed </s>
<s> The events and incidents of the conflict--making up a whole, in varied amplitude, corresponding with the geographical area covered by the war--from these but a few themes have been taken, such as for any cause chanced to imprint themselves upon the mind </s>
<s> The aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are the moods of involuntary meditation--moods variable, and at times widely at variance </s>
<s> Yielding instinctively, one after another, to feelings not inspired from any one source exclusively, and unmindful, without purposing to be, of consistency, I seem, in most of these verses, to have but placed a harp in a window, and noted the contrasted airs which wayward wilds have played upon the strings.] The Portent </s>
<s> (1859.) Hanging from the beam, Slowly swaying (such the law), Gaunt the shadow on your green, Shenandoah </s>
<s> The cut is on the crown (Lo, John Brown), And the stabs shall heal no more </s>
<s> Hidden in the cap Is the anguish none can draw; So your future veils its face, Shenandoah </s>
<s> But the streaming beard is shown (Weird John Brown), The meteor of the the war </s>
<s> Misgivings </s>
<s> (1860.) When ocean-clouds over inland hills Sweep storming in late autumn brown, And horror the sodden valley fills, And the spire falls crashing in the town, I muse upon my country's ills-- The tempest bursting from the waste of Time On the world's fairest hope linked with man's foulest crime </s>
<s> Nature's dark side is heeded now-- (Ah </s>
<s> optimist-cheer disheartened flown)-- A child may read the moody brow Of yon black mountain lone </s>
<s> With shouts the torrents down the gorges go, And storms are formed behind the storm we feel: The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel </s>
<s> The Conflict of Convictions.[1] (1860-1.) On starry heights A bugle wails the long recall; Derision stirs the deep abyss, Heaven's ominous silence over all </s>
<s> Return, return, O eager Hope, And face man's latter fall </s>
<s> Events, they make the dreamers quail; Satan's old age is strong and hale, A disciplined captain, gray in skill, And Raphael a white enthusiast still; Dashed aims, at which Christ's martyrs pale, Shall Mammon's slaves fulfill </s>
<s> (_Dismantle the fort, Cut down the fleet-- Battle no more shall be </s>
<s> While the fields for fight in Ã¦ons to come Congeal beneath the sea._) The terrors of truth and dart of death To faith alike are vain; Though comets, gone a thousand years, Return again, Patient she stands--she can no more-- And waits, nor heeds she waxes hoar </s>
<s> (_At a stony gate, A statue of stone, Weed overgrown-- Long 'twill wait!_) But God his former mind retains, Confirms his old decree; The generations are inured to pains, And strong Necessity Surges, and heaps Time's strand with wrecks </s>
<s> The People spread like a weedy grass, The thing they will they bring to pass, And prosper to the apoplex </s>
<s> The rout it herds around the heart, The ghost is yielded in the gloom; Kings wag their heads--Now save thyself Who wouldst rebuild the world in bloom </s>
<s> (_Tide-mark And top of the ages' strike, Verge where they called the world to come, The last advance of life-- Ha ha, the rust on the Iron Dome!_) Nay, but revere the hid event; In the cloud a sword is girded on, I mark a twinkling in the tent Of Michael the warrior one </s>
<s> Senior wisdom suits not now, The light is on the youthful brow </s>
<s> (_Ay, in caves the miner see: His forehead bears a blinking light; Darkness so he feebly braves-- A meagre wight!_) But He who rules is old--is old; Ah </s>
<s> faith is warm, but heaven with age is cold </s>
<s> (_Ho ho, ho ho, The cloistered doubt Of olden times Is blurted out!_) The Ancient of Days forever is young, Forever the scheme of Nature thrives; I know a wind in purpose strong-- It spins _against_ the way it drives </s>
<s> What if the gulfs their slimed foundations bare </s>
<s> So deep must the stones be hurled Whereon the throes of ages rear The final empire and the happier world </s>
<s> (_The poor old Past, The Future's slave, She drudged through pain and crime To bring about the blissful Prime, Then--perished </s>
<s> There's a grave!_) Power unanointed may come-- Dominion (unsought by the free) And the Iron Dome, Stronger for stress and strain, Fling her huge shadow athwart the main; But the Founders' dream shall flee </s>
<s> Agee after age shall be As age after age has been, (From man's changeless heart their way they win); And death be busy with all who strive-- Death, with silent negative </s>
<s> YEA, AND NAY-- EACH HATH HIS SAY; BUT GOD HE KEEPS THE MIDDLE WAY </s>
<s> NONE WAS BY WHEN HE SPREAD THE SKY; WISDOM IS VAIN, AND PROPHESY </s>
<s> Apathy and Enthusiasm </s>
<s> (1860-1.) I O the clammy cold November, And the winter white and dead, And the terror dumb with stupor, And the sky a sheet of lead; And events that came resounding With the cry that _All was lost_, Like the thunder-cracks of massy ice In intensity of frost-- Bursting one upon another Through the horror of the calm </s>
<s> The paralysis of arm In the anguish of the heart; And the hollowness and dearth </s>
<s> The appealings of the mother To brother and to brother Not in hatred so to part-- And the fissure in the hearth Growing momently more wide </s>
<s> Then the glances 'tween the Fates, And the doubt on every side, And the patience under gloom In the stoniness that waits The finality of doom </s>
<s> II So the winter died despairing, And the weary weeks of Lent; And the ice-bound rivers melted, And the tomb of Faith was rent </s>
<s> O, the rising of the People Came with springing of the grass, They rebounded from dejection And Easter came to pass </s>
<s> And the young were all elation Hearing Sumter's cannon roar, And they thought how tame the Nation In the age that went before </s>
<s> And Michael seemed gigantical, The Arch-fiend but a dwarf; And at the towers of Erebus Our striplings flung the scoff </s>
<s> But the elders with foreboding Mourned the days forever o'er, And re called the forest proverb, The Iroquois' old saw: _Grief to every graybeard When young Indians lead the war._ The March into Virginia, Ending in the First Manassas </s>
<s> (July, 1861.) Did all the lets and bars appear To every just or larger end, Whence should come the trust and cheer </s>
<s> Youth must its ignorant impulse lend-- Age finds place in the rear </s>
<s> All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys, The champions and enthusiasts of the state: Turbid ardors and vain joys Not barrenly abate-- Stimulants to the power mature, Preparatives of fate </s>
<s> Who here forecasteth the event </s>
<s> What heart but spurns at precedent And warnings of the wise, Contemned foreclosures of surprise </s>
<s> The banners play, the bugles call, The air is blue and prodigal </s>
<s> No berrying party, pleasure-wooed, No picnic party in the May, Ever went less loth than they Into that leafy neighborhood </s>
<s> In Bacchic glee they file toward Fate, Moloch's uninitiate; Expectancy, and glad surmise Of battle's unknown mysteries </s>
<s> All they feel is this: 'tis glory, A rapture sharp, though transitory, Yet lasting in belaureled story </s>
<s> So they gayly go to fight, Chatting left and laughing right </s>
<s> But some who this blithe mood present, As on in lightsome files they fare, Shall die experienced ere three days are spent-- Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare; Or shame survive, and, like to adamant, The throe of Second Manassas share </s>
<s> Lyon </s>
<s> Battle of Springfield, Missouri </s>
<s> (August, 1861.) Some hearts there are of deeper sort, Prophetic, sad, Which yet for cause are trebly clad; Known death they fly on: This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon </s>
<s> "They are more than twenty thousand strong, We less than five, Too few with such a host to strive" "Such counsel, fie on </s>
<s> 'Tis battle, or 'tis shame;" and firm stood Lyon </s>
<s> "For help at need in van we wait-- Retreat or fight: Retreat the foe would take for flight, And each proud scion Feel more elate; the end must come," said Lyon </s>
<s> By candlelight he wrote the will, And left his all To Her for whom 'twas not enough to fall; Loud neighed Orion Without the tent; drums beat; we marched with Lyon </s>
<s> The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale With guard-fires lit; Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it: "A field to die on" Presaged in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon </s>
<s> We fought on the grass, we bled in the corn-- Fate seemed malign; His horse the Leader led along the line-- Star-browed Orion; Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon </s>
<s> There came a sound like the slitting of air By a swift sharp sword-- A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad Of black Orion Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon </s>
<s> "General, you're hurt--this sleet of balls" </s>
<s> He seemed half spent; With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent: "The field to die on; But not--not yet; the day is long," breathed Lyon </s>
<s> For a time becharmed there fell a lull In the heart of the fight; The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light; Warm noon-winds sigh on, And thoughts which he never spake had Lyon </s>
<s> Texans and Indians trim for a charge: "Stand ready, men </s>
<s> Let them come close, right up, and then After the lead, the iron; Fire, and charge back" </s>
<s> So strength returned to Lyon </s>
<s> The Iowa men who held the van, Half drilled, were new To battle: "Some one lead us, then we'll do" Said Corporal Tryon: "Men </s>
<s> _I_ will lead," and a light glared in Lyon </s>
<s> On they came: they yelped, and fired; His spirit sped; We leveled right in, and the half-breeds fled, Nor stayed the iron, Nor captured the crimson corse of Lyon </s>
<s> This seer foresaw his soldier-doom, Yet willed the fight </s>
<s> He never turned; his only flight Was up to Zion, Where prophets now and armies greet brave Lyon </s>
<s> Ball's Bluff </s>
<s> A Reverie </s>
<s> (October, 1861.) One noonday, at my window in the town, I saw a sight--saddest that eyes can see-- Young soldiers marching lustily Unto the wars, With fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry; While all the porches, walks, and doors Were rich with ladies cheering royally </s>
<s> They moved like Juny morning on the wave, Their hearts were fresh as clover in its prime (It was the breezy summer time), Life throbbed so strong, How should they dream that Death in a rosy clime Would come to thin their shining throng </s>
<s> Youth feels immortal, like the gods sublime </s>
<s> Weeks passed; and at my window, leaving bed, By night I mused, of easeful sleep bereft, On those brave boys (Ah War </s>
<s> thy theft); Some marching feet Found pause at last by cliffs Potomac cleft; Wakeful I mused, while in the street Far footfalls died away till none were left </s>
<s> Dupont's Round Fight </s>
<s> (November, 1861.) In time and measure perfect moves All Art whose aim is sure; Evolving ryhme and stars divine Have rules, and they endure </s>
<s> Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right, And, warring so, prevailed, In geometric beauty curved, And in an orbit sailed </s>
<s> The rebel at Port Royal felt The Unity overawe, And rued the spell </s>
<s> A type was here, And victory of Law </s>
<s> The Stone Fleet.[2] An Old Sailor's Lament </s>
<s> (December, 1861.) I have a feeling for those ships, Each worn and ancient one, With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam; Ay, it was unkindly done </s>
<s> But so they serve the Obsolete-- Even so, Stone Fleet </s>
<s> You'll say I'm doting; do but think I scudded round the Horn in one-- The Tenedos, a glorious Good old craft as ever run-- Sunk (how all unmeet!) With the Old Stone Fleet </s>
<s> An India ship of fame was she, Spices and shawls and fans she bore; A whaler when her wrinkles came-- Turned off </s>
<s> till, spent and poor, Her bones were sold (escheat) </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> Stone Fleet </s>
<s> Four were erst patrician keels (Names attest what families be), The Kensington, and Richmond too, Leonidas, and Lee: But now they have their seat With the Old Stone Fleet </s>
<s> To scuttle them--a pirate deed-- Sack them, and dismast; They sunk so slow, they died so hard, But gurgling dropped at last </s>
<s> Their ghosts in gales repeat _Woe's us, Stone Fleet!_ And all for naught </s>
<s> The waters pass-- Currents will have their way; Nature is nobody's ally; 'tis well; The harbor is bettered--will stay </s>
<s> A failure, and complete, Was your Old Stone Fleet </s>
<s> Donelson </s>
<s> (February, 1862.) The bitter cup Of that hard countermand Which gave the Envoys up, Still was wormwood in the mouth, And clouds involved the land, When, pelted by sleet in the icy street, About the bulletin-board a band Of eager, anxious people met, And every wakeful heart was set On latest news from West or South </s>
<s> "No seeing here," cries one--"don't crowd--" "You tall man, pray you, read aloud" </s>
<s> IMPORTANT </s>
<s> _We learn that General Grant, Marching from Henry overland, And joined by a force up the Cumberland sent (Some thirty thousand the command), On Wednesday a good position won-- Began the siege of Donelson </s>
<s> The stronghold crowns a river-bluff, A good broad mile of leveled top; Inland the ground rolls off Deep-gorged, and rocky, and broken up-- A wilderness of trees and brush </s>
<s> The spaded summit shows the roods Of fixed intrenchments in their hush; Breast-works and rifle-pits in woods Perplex the base.-- The welcome weather Is clear and mild; 'tis much like May </s>
<s> The ancient boughs that lace together Along the stream, and hang far forth, Strange with green mistletoe, betray A dreamy contrast to the North </s>
<s> Our troops are full of spirits--say The siege won't prove a creeping one </s>
<s> They purpose not the lingering stay Of old beleaguerers; not that way; But, full of _vim_ from Western prairies won, They'll make, ere long, a dash at Donelson._ Washed by the storm till the paper grew Every shade of a streaky blue, That bulletin stood </s>
<s> The next day brought A second </s>
<s> LATER FROM THE FORT </s>
<s> _Grant's investment is complete-- A semicircular one </s>
<s> Both wings the Cumberland's margin meet, Then, backwkard curving, clasp the rebel seat </s>
<s> On Wednesday this good work was done; But of the doers some lie prone </s>
<s> Each wood, each hill, each glen was fought for; The bold inclosing line we wrought for Flamed with sharpshooters </s>
<s> Each cliff cost A limb or life </s>
<s> But back we forced Reserves and all; made good our hold; And so we rest </s>
<s> Events unfold </s>
<s> On Thursday added ground was won, A long bold steep: we near the Den </s>
<s> Later the foe came shouting down In sortie, which was quelled; and then We stormed them on their left </s>
<s> A chilly change in the afternoon; The sky, late clear, is now bereft Of sun </s>
<s> Last night the ground froze hard-- Rings to the enemy as they run Within their works </s>
<s> A ramrod bites The lip it meets </s>
<s> The cold incites To swinging of arms with brisk rebound </s>
<s> Smart blows 'gainst lusty chests resound </s>
<s> Along the outer line we ward A crackle of skirmishing goes on </s>
<s> Our lads creep round on hand and knee, They fight from behind each trunk and stone; And sometimes, flying for refuge, one Finds 'tis an enemy shares the tree </s>
<s> Some scores are maimed by boughs shot off In the glades by the Fort's big gun </s>
<s> We mourn the loss of colonel Morrison, Killed while cheering his regiment on </s>
<s> Their far sharpshooters try our stuff; And ours return them puff for puff: 'Tis diamond-cutting-diamond work </s>
<s> Woe on the rebel cannoneer Who shows his head </s>
<s> Our fellows lurk Like Indians that waylay the deer By the wild salt-spring.--The sky is dun, Fordooming the fall of Donelson </s>
<s> Stern weather is all unwonted here </s>
<s> The people of the country own We brought it </s>
<s> Yea, the earnest North Has elementally issued forth To storm this Donelson._ FURTHER </s>
<s> A yelling rout Of ragamuffins broke profuse To-day from out the Fort </s>
<s> Sole uniform they wore, a sort Of patch, or white badge (as you choose) Upon the arm </s>
<s> But leading these, Or mingling, were men of face And bearing of patrician race, Splendid in courage and gold lace-- The officers </s>
<s> Before the breeze Made by their charge, down went our line; But, rallying, charged back in force, And broke the sally; yet with loss </s>
<s> This on the left; upon the right Meanwhile there was an answering fight; Assailants and assailed reversed </s>
<s> The charge too upward, and not down-- Up a steep ridge-side, toward its crown, A strong redoubt </s>
<s> But they who first Gained the fort's base, and marked the trees Felled, heaped in horned perplexities, And shagged with brush; and swarming there Fierce wasps whose sting was present death-- They faltered, drawing bated breath, And felt it was in vain to dare; Yet still, perforce, returned the ball, Firing into the tangled wall Till ordered to come down </s>
<s> They came; But left some comrades in their fame, Red on the ridge in icy wreath And hanging gardens of cold Death </s>
<s> But not quite unavenged these fell; Our ranks once out of range, a blast Of shrapnel and quick shell Burst on the rebel horde, still massed, Scattering them pell-mell </s>
<s> (This fighting--judging what we read-- Both charge and countercharge, Would seem but Thursday's told at large, Before in brief reported.--Ed.) Night closed in about the Den Murky and lowering </s>
<s> Ere long, chill rains </s>
<s> A night not soon to be forgot, Reviving old rheumatic pains And longings for a cot </s>
<s> No blankets, overcoats, or tents </s>
<s> Coats thrown aside on the warm march here-- We looked not then for changeful cheer; Tents, coats, and blankets too much care </s>
<s> No fires; a fire a mark presents; Near by, the trees show bullet-dents </s>
<s> Rations were eaten cold and raw </s>
<s> The men well soaked, come snow; and more-- A midnight sally </s>
<s> Small sleeping done-- But such is war; No matter, we'll have Fort Donelson._ "Ugh </s>
<s> ugh </s>
<s> 'Twill drag along--drag along" Growled a cross patriot in the throng, His battered umbrella like an ambulance-cover Riddled with bullet-holes, spattered all over </s>
<s> "Hurrah for Grant" </s>
<s> cried a stripling shrill; Three urchins joined him with a will, And some of taller stature cheered </s>
<s> Meantime a Copperhead passed; he sneered </s>
<s> "Win or lose," he pausing said, "Caps fly the same; all boys, mere boys; Any thing to make a noise </s>
<s> Like to see the list of the dead; These '_craven Southerners_' hold out; Ay, ay, they'll give you many a bout" "We'll beat in the end, sir" Firmly said one in staid rebuke, A solid merchant, square and stout </s>
<s> "And do you think it </s>
<s> that way tend, sir" Asked the lean Cooperhead, with a look Of splenetic pity </s>
<s> "Yes, I do" His yellow death's head the croaker shook: "The country's ruined, that I know" A shower of broken ice and snow, In lieu of words, confuted him; They saw him hustled round the corner go, And each by-stander said--Well suited him </s>
<s> Next day another crowd was seen In the dark weather's sleety spleen </s>
<s> Bald-headed to the storm came out A man, who, 'mid a joyous shout, Silently posted this brief sheet: GLORIOUS VICTORY OF THE FLEET </s>
<s> FRIDAY'S GREAT EVENT </s>
<s> THE ENEMY'S WATER-BATTERIES BEAT </s>
<s> WE SILENCED EVERY GUN </s>
<s> THE OLD COMMODORE'S COMPLIMENTS SENT PLUMP INTO DONELSON </s>
<s> "Well, well, go on" </s>
<s> exclaimed the crowd To him who thus much read aloud </s>
<s> "That's all," he said </s>
<s> "What </s>
<s> nothing more" "Enough for a cheer, though--hip, hurrah" </s>
<s> "But here's old Baldy come again--" "More news"!--And now a different strain </s>
<s> (Our own reporter a dispatch compiles, As best he may, from varied sources.) Large re-enforcements have arrived-- Munitions, men, and horses-- For Grant, and all debarked, with stores </s>
<s> The enemy's field-works extend six miles-- The gate still hid; so well contrived </s>
<s> Yesterday stung us; frozen shores Snow-clad, and through the drear defiles And over the desolate ridges blew A Lapland wind </s>
<s> The main affair Was a good two hours' steady fight Between our gun-boats and the Fort </s>
<s> The Louisville's wheel was smashed outright </s>
<s> A hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound ball Came planet-like through a starboard port, Killing three men, and wounding all The rest of that gun's crew, (The captain of the gun was cut in two); Then splintering and ripping went-- Nothing could be its continent </s>
<s> In the narrow stream the Louisville, Unhelmed, grew lawless; swung around, And would have thumped and drifted, till All the fleet was driven aground, But for the timely order to retire </s>
<s> Some damage from our fire, 'tis thought, Was done the water-batteries of the Fort </s>
<s> Little else took place that day, Except the field artillery in line Would now and then--for love, they say-- Exchange a valentine </s>
<s> The old sharpshooting going on </s>
<s> Some plan afoot as yet unknown; So Friday closed round Donelson </s>
<s> LATER </s>
<s> Great suffering through the night-- A stinging one </s>
<s> Our heedless boys Were nipped like blossoms </s>
<s> Some dozen Hapless wounded men were frozen </s>
<s> During day being struck down out of sight, And help-cries drowned in roaring noise, They were left just where the skirmish shifted-- Left in dense underbrush now-drifted </s>
<s> Some, seeking to crawl in crippled plight, So stiffened--perished </s>
<s> Yet in spite Of pangs for these, no heart is lost </s>
<s> Hungry, and clothing stiff with frost, Our men declare a nearing sun Shall see the fall of Donelson </s>
<s> And this they say, yet not disown The dark redoubts round Donelson, And ice-glazed corpses, each a stone-- A sacrifice to Donelson; They swear it, and swerve not, gazing on A flag, deemed black, flying from Donelson </s>
<s> Some of the wounded in the wood Were cared for by the foe last night, Though he could do them little needed good, Himself being all in shivering plight </s>
<s> The rebel is wrong, but human yet; He's got a heart, and thrusts a bayonet </s>
<s> He gives us battle with wondrous will-- The bluff's a perverted Bunker Hill._ The stillness stealing through the throng The silent thought and dismal fear revealed; They turned and went, Musing on right and wrong And mysteries dimly sealed-- Breasting the storm in daring discontent; The storm, whose black flag showed in heaven, As if to say no quarter there was given To wounded men in wood, Or true hearts yearning for the good-- All fatherless seemed the human soul </s>
<s> But next day brought a bitterer bowl-- On the bulletin-board this stood; _Saturday morning at 3 A.M </s>
<s> A stir within the Fort betrayed That the rebels were getting under arms; Some plot these early birds had laid </s>
<s> But a lancing sleet cut him who stared Into the storm </s>
<s> After some vague alarms, Which left our lads unscared, Out sallied the enemy at dim of dawn, With cavalry and artillery, and went In fury at our environment </s>
<s> Under cover of shot and shell Three columns of infantry rolled on, Vomited out of Donelson-- Rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell, Surged at our line, and swelled and poured Like breaking surf </s>
<s> But unsubmerged Our men stood up, except where roared The enemy through one gap </s>
<s> We urged Our all of manhood to the stress, But still showed shattered in our desperateness </s>
<s> Back set the tide, But soon afresh rolled in; And so it swayed from side to side-- Far batteries joining in the din, Though sharing in another fray-- Till all became an Indian fight, Intricate, dusky, stretching far away, Yet not without spontaneous plan However tangled showed the plight; Duels all over 'tween man and man, Duels on cliff-side, and down in ravine, Duels at long range, and bone to bone; Duels every where flitting and half unseen </s>
<s> Only by courage good as their own, And strength outlasting theirs, Did our boys at last drive the rebels off </s>
<s> Yet they went not back to their distant lairs In strong-hold, but loud in scoff Maintained themselves on conquered ground-- Uplands; built works, or stalked around </s>
<s> Our right wing bore this onset </s>
<s> Noon Brought calm to Donelson </s>
<s> The reader ceased; the storm beat hard; 'Twas day, but the office-gas was lit; Nature retained her sulking-fit, In her hand the shard </s>
<s> Flitting faces took the hue Of that washed bulletin-board in view, And seemed to bear the public grief As private, and uncertain of relief; Yea, many an earnest heart was won, As broodingly he plodded on, To find in himself some bitter thing, Some hardness in his lot as harrowing As Donelson </s>
<s> That night the board stood barren there, Oft eyes by wistful people passing, Who nothing saw but the rain-beads chasing Each other down the wafered square, As down some storm-beat grave-yard stone </s>
<s> But next day showed-- MORE NEWS LAST NIGHT </s>
<s> STORY OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON </s>
<s> VICISSITUDES OF THE WAR </s>
<s> _The damaged gun-boats can't wage fight For days; so says the Commodore </s>

<s> Their ranks all riven Are being replaced by fresh, strong men </s>
<s> Great vigilance in the foeman's Den; He snuffs the stormers </s>
<s> Need it is That for that fell assault of his, That rout inflicted, and self-scorn-- Immoderate in noble natures, torn By sense of being through slackness overborne-- The rebel be given a quick return: The kindest face looks now half stern </s>
<s> Balked of their prey in airs that freeze, Some fierce ones glare like savages </s>
<s> And yet, and yet, strange moments are-- Well--blood, and tears, and anguished War </s>
<s> The morning's battle-ground is seen In lifted glades, like meadows rare; The blood-drops on the snow-crust there Like clover in the white-week show-- Flushed fields of death, that call again-- Call to our men, and not in vain, For that way must the stormers go </s>

<s> Doubtless, ere morning, we shall hear The end; we look for news to cheer-- Let Hope fan all her fires.)_ Next day in large bold hand was seen The closing bulletin: VICTORY </s>
<s> _Our troops have retrieved the day By one grand surge along the line; The spirit that urged them was divine </s>
<s> The first works flooded, naught could stay The stormers: on </s>
<s> still on </s>
<s> Bayonets for Donelson </s>
<s> Over the ground that morning lost Rolled the blue billows, tempest-tossed, Following a hat on the point of a sword </s>
<s> Spite shell and round-shot, grape and canister, Up they climbed without rail or banister-- Up the steep hill-sides long and broad, Driving the rebel deep within his works </s>
<s> 'Tis nightfall; not an enemy lurks In sight </s>
<s> The chafing men Fret for more fight: "To-night, to-night let us take the Den" But night is treacherous, Grant is wary; Of brave blood be a little chary </s>
<s> Patience </s>

<s> O, to the punches brewed that night Went little water </s>
<s> Windows bright Beamed rosy on the sleet without, And from the deep street came the frequent shout; While some in prayer, as these in glee, Blessed heaven for the winter-victory </s>

<s> Men fall from their saddles like plums from trees; Horses take fright, reins tangle and bind; "Steady--Dismount--form--and into the wood" They go, but find what scarce can please: Their steeds have been tied in the field behind, And Mosby's men are off like the wind </s>
<s> Sound the recall </s>

<s> The Hospital Steward--even he-- Who on the sleeper kept his glance, Was changed; late bright-black beard and eye Looked now hearse-black; his heavy heart, Like his fagged mare, no more could dance; His grape was now a raisin dry: 'Tis Mosby's homily--_Man must die_ </s>

<s> Plutarch relates that in a military council held by Pompey and the chiefs of that party which stood for the Commonwealth, it was decided that under no plea should any city be sacked that was subject to the people of Rome </s>
<s> There was this difference, however, between the Roman civil conflict and the American one </s>
<s> The war of Pompey and Caesar divided the Roman people promiscuously; that of the North and South ran a frontier line between what for the time were distinct communities or nations </s>

<s> But the expectations build hereon (if, indeed, ever soberly entertained), happily for the country, have not been verified </s>

<s> Their color-bearers stepped defiantly to the front as the engagement opened furiously; the rebels pouring in sharp, quick volleys of musketry, and their batteries above continuing to support them with a destructive fire </s>
<s> Our sharpshooters wanted to pick off the audacious rebel color-bearers, but Colonel Stuart interposed: 'No, no, they're too brave fellows to be killed'." 17 </s>
<s> According to a report of the Secretary of War, there were on the first day of March, 1865, 965,000 men on the army pay-rolls </s>

<s> For a month or two after the completion of peace, some thousands of released captives from the military prisons of the North, natives of all parts of the South, passed through the city of New York, sometimes waiting farther transportation for days, during which interval they wandered penniless about the streets, or lay in their worn and patched gray uniforms under the trees of Battery, near the barracks where they were lodged and fed </s>

<s> South of the Potamac in Virginia, and within a gallop of the Long Bridge at Washington, is the confine of a country, in some places wild, which throughout the war it was unsafe for a Union man to traverse except with an armed escort </s>
<s> This was the chase of Mosby, the scene of many of his exploits or those of his men </s>
<s> In the heart of this region at least one fortified camp was maintained by our cavalry, and from time to time expeditions ended disastrously </s>
<s> Such results were helped by the exceeding cunning of the enemy, born of his wood-craft, and, in some instances, by undue confidence on the part of our men </s>
<s> A body of cavalry, starting from camp with the view of breaking up a nest of rangers, and absent say three days, would return with a number of their own forces killed and wounded (ambushed), without being able to retaliate farther than by foraging on the country, destroying a house or two reported to be haunts of the guerrillas, or capturing non-combatants accused of being secretly active in their behalf </s>
<s> In the verse the name of Mosby is invested with some of those associations with which the popular mind is familiar </s>

<s> Among those summoned during the spring just passed to appear before the Reconstruction Committee of Congress was Robert E </s>
<s> Lee </s>

<s> Waiving this invitation, he responded by a short personal explanation of some point in a previous answer, and after a few more brief questions and replies, the interview closed </s>
<s> In the verse a poetical liberty has been ventured </s>
<s> Lee is not only represented as responding to the invitation, but also as at last renouncing his cold reserve, doubtless the cloak to feelings more or less poignant </s>
<s> If for such freedom warrant be necessary the speeches in ancient histories, not to speak of those in Shakespeare's historic plays, may not unfitly perhaps be cited </s>
<s> The character of the original measures proposed about time in the National Legislature for the treatment of the (as yet) Congressionally excluded South, and the spirit in which those measures were advocated--these are circumstances which it is fairly supposable would have deeply influenced the thoughts, whether spoken or withheld, of a Southerner placed in the position of Lee before the Reconstruction Committee </s>
<s> Supplement </s>
<s> Were I fastidiously anxious for the symmetry of this book, it would close with the notes </s>
<s> But the times are such that patriotism--not free from solicitude--urges a claim overriding all literary scruples </s>
<s> It is more than a year since the memorable surrender, but events have not yet rounded themselves into completion </s>
<s> Not justly can we complain of this </s>
<s> There has been an upheavel affecting the basis of things; to altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be made; there are difficulties great and novel </s>
<s> But is Reason still waiting for Passion to spend itself </s>
<s> We have sung of the soldiers and sailors, but who shall hymn the politicians </s>
<s> In view of the infinite desirableness of Re-establishment, and considering that, so far as feeling is concerned, it depends not mainly on the temper in which the South regards the North, but rather conversely; one who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to submit some thoughts, counting on the indulgence of his countrymen </s>
<s> And, first, it may be said that, if among the feelings and opinions growing immediately out of a great civil convulsion, there are any which time shall modify or do away, they are presumably those of a less temperate and charitable cast </s>
<s> There seems no reason why patriotism and narrowness should go together, or why intellectual impartiality should be confounded with political trimming, or why serviceable truth should keep cloistered be a cause not partisan </s>
<s> Yet the work of Reconstruction, if admitted to be feasible at all, demands little but common sense and Christian charity </s>
<s> Little but these </s>
<s> These are much </s>
<s> Some of us are concerned because as yet the South shows no penitence </s>
<s> But what exactly do we mean by this </s>
<s> Since down to the close of the war she never confessed any for braving it, the only penitence now left her is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture; and since this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical, it would be unworthy in us to demand it </s>
<s> Certain it is that penitence, in the sense of voluntary humiliation, will never be displayed </s>
<s> Nor does this afford just ground for unreserved condemnation </s>
<s> It is enough, for all practical purposes, if the South have been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel that Secession, like Slavery, is against Destiny; that both now lie buried in one grave; that her fate is linked with ours; and that together we comprise the Nation </s>
<s> The clouds of heroes who battled for the Union it is needless to eulogize here </s>
<s> But how of the soldiers on the other side </s>
<s> And when of a free community we name the soldiers, we thereby name the people </s>
<s> It was in subserviency to the slave-interest that Secession was plotted; but it was under the plea, plausibly urged, that certain inestimable rights guaranteed by the Constitution were directly menaced, that the people of the South were cajoled into revolution </s>
<s> Through the arts of the conspirators and the perversity of fortune, the most sensitive love of liberty was entrapped into the support of a war whose implied end was the erecting in our advanced century of an Anglo-American empire based upon the systematic degradation of man </s>
<s> Spite this clinging reproach, however, signal military virtues and achievements have conferred upon the Confederate arms historic fame, and upon certain of the commanders a renown extending beyond the sea--a renown which we of the North could not suppress even if we would </s>
<s> In personal character, also, not a few of the military leaders of the South enforce forbearance; the memory of others the North refrains from disparaging; and some, with more or less of reluctance, she can respect </s>
<s> Posterity, sympathizing with our convictions, but removed from our passions, may perhaps go farther here </s>
<s> If George IV </s>
<s> could out of the graceful instinct of a gentleman, raise an honorable monument in the great fane of Christendom over the remains of the enemy of his dynasty, Charles Edward, the invader of England and victor in the rout at Preston Pans--Upon whose head the king's ancestor but one reign removed has set a price--is it probable that the grandchildren of General Grant will pursue with rancor, or slur by sour neglect, the memory of Stonewall Jackson </s>
<s> But the South herself is not wanting in recent histories and biographies which record the deeds of her chieftains--writings freely published at the North by loyal houses, widely read here, and with a deep though saddened interest </s>
<s> By students of the war such works are hailed as welcome accessories, and tending to the completeness of the record </s>
<s> Supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities, then, in the generation next to come, Southerners there will be yielding allegiance to the Union, feeling all their interests bound up in it, and yet cherishing unrebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers of the fallen Confederacy that Burns, Scott, and the Ettrick Shepherd felt for the memory of the gallant clansmen ruined through their fidelity to the Stuarts--a feeling whose passion was tempered by the poetry imbuing it, and which in no wise affected their loyalty to the Georges, and which, it may be added, indirectly contributed excellent things to literature </s>
<s> But, setting this view aside, dishonorable would it be in the South were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness warred in her behalf, though from motives, as we believe, so deplorably astray </s>
<s> Patriotism is not baseness, neither is it inhumanity </s>
<s> The mourners who this summer bear flowers to the mounds of the Virginian and Georgian dead are, in their domestic bereavement and proud affection, as sacred in the eye of Heaven as are those who go with similar offerings of tender grief and love into the cemeteries of our Northern martyrs </s>
<s> And yet, in one aspect, how needless to point the contrast </s>
<s> Cherishing such sentiments, it will hardly occasion surprise that, in looking over the battle-pieces in the foregoing collection, I have been tempted to withdraw or modify some of them, fearful lest in presenting, though but dramatically and by way of a poetic record, the passions and epithets of civil war, I might be contributing to a bitterness which every sensible American must wish at an end </s>
<s> So, too, with the emotion of victory as reproduced on some pages, and particularly toward the close </s>
<s> It should not be construed into an exultation misapplied--an exultation as ungenerous as unwise, and made to minister, however indirectly, to that kind of censoriousness too apt to be produced in certain natures by success after trying reverses </s>
<s> Zeal is not of necessity religion, neither is it always of the same essence with poetry or patriotism </s>
<s> There were excesses which marked the conflict, most of which are perhaps inseparable from a civil strife so intense and prolonged, and involving warfare in some border countries new and imperfectly civilized </s>
<s> Barbarities also there were, for which the Southern people collectively can hardly be held responsible, though perpetrated by ruffians in their name </s>
<s> But surely other qualities--exalted ones--courage and fortitude matchless, were likewise displayed, and largely; and justly may these be held the characteristic traits, and not the former </s>
<s> In this view, what Northern writer, however patriotic, but must revolt from acting on paper a part any way akin to that of the live dog to the dead lion; and yet it is right to rejoice for our triumph, so far as it may justly imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity </s>
<s> Let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads for reasonable consideration for our late enemies, now stricken down and unavoidably debarred, for the time, from speaking through authorized agencies for themselves </s>
<s> Nothing has been urged here in the foolish hope of conciliating those men--few in number, we trust--who have resolved never to be reconciled to the Union </s>
<s> On such hearts every thing is thrown away except it be religious commiseration, and the sincerest </s>
<s> Yet let them call to mind that unhappy Secessionist, not a military man, who with impious alacrity fired the first shot of the Civil War at Sumter, and a little more than four years afterward fired the last one into his own heart at Richmond </s>
<s> Noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion surprised the people in a utilitarian time and country; yet the glory of the war falls short of its pathos--a pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity </s>
<s> How many and earnest thoughts still rise, and how hard to repress them </s>
<s> We feel what past years have been, and years, unretarded years, shall come </s>
<s> May we all have moderation; may we all show candor </s>
<s> Though, perhaps, nothing could ultimately have averted the strife, and though to treat of human actions is to deal wholly with second causes, nevertheless, let us not cover up or try to extenuate what, humanly speaking, is the truth--namely, that those unfraternal denunciations, continued through years, and which at last inflamed to deeds that ended in bloodshed, were reciprocal; and that, had the preponderating strength and the prospect of its unlimited increase lain on the other side, on ours might have lain those actions which now in our late opponents we stigmatize under the name of Rebellion </s>
<s> As frankly let us own--what it would be unbecoming to parade were foreigners concerned--that our triumph was won not more by skill and bravery than by superior resources and crushing numbers; that it was a triumph, too, over a people for years politically misled by designing men, and also by some honestly-erring men, who from their position could not have been otherwise than broadly influential; a people who, though indeed, they sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery, and even extend it, were not the authors of it, but (less fortunate, not less righteous than we) were the fated inheritors; a people who, having a like origin with ourselves, share essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess </s>
<s> No one can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless defeat has now cast upon Secession by withholding the recognition of these verities </s>
<s> Surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of pacification, based upon principles operating equally all over the land, which lovers of their country yearn for, and which our arms, though signally triumphant, did not bring about, and which law-making, however anxious, or energetic, or repressive, never by itself can achieve, may yet be largely aided by generosity of sentiment public and private </s>
<s> Some revisionary legislation and adaptive is indispensable; but with this should harmoniously work another kind of prudence not unallied with entire magnanimity </s>
<s> Benevolence and policy--Christianity and Machiavelli--dissuade from penal severities toward the subdued </s>
<s> Abstinence here is as obligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate fellow-men late in bonds, and, if observed, would equally prove to be wise forecast </s>
<s> The great qualities of the South, those attested in the War, we can perilously alienate, or we may make them nationally available at need </s>
<s> The blacks, in their infant pupilage to freedom, appeal to the sympathies of every humane mind </s>
<s> The paternal guardianship which for the interval government exercises over them was prompted equally by duty and benevolence </s>
<s> Yet such kindliness should not be allowed to exclude kindliness to communities who stand nearer to us in nature </s>
<s> For the future of the freed slaves we may well be concerned; but the future of the whole country, involving the future of the blacks, urges a paramount claim upon our anxiety </s>
<s> Effective benignity, like the Nile, is not narrow in its bounty, and true policy is always broad </s>
<s> To be sure, it is vain to seek to glide, with moulded words, over the difficulties of the situation </s>
<s> And for them who are neither partisans, nor enthusiasts, nor theorists, nor cynics, there are some doubts not readily to be solved </s>
<s> And there are fears </s>
<s> Why is not the cessation of war now at length attended with the settled calm of peace </s>
<s> Wherefore in a clear sky do we still turn our eyes toward the South, as the Neapolitan, months after the eruption, turns his toward Vesuvius </s>
<s> Do we dread lest the repose may be deceptive </s>
<s> In the recent convulsion has the crater but shifted </s>
<s> Let us revere that sacred uncertainty which forever impends over men and nations </s>
<s> Those of us who always abhorred slavery as an atheistical iniquity, gladly we join in the exulting chorus of humanity over its downfall </s>
<s> But we should remember that emancipation was accomplished not by deliberate legislation; only through agonized violence could so mighty a result be effected </s>
<s> In our natural solicitude to confirm the benefit of liberty to the blacks, let us forbear from measures of dubious constitutional rightfulness toward our white countrymen --measures of a nature to provoke, among other of the last evils, exterminating hatred of race toward race </s>
<s> In imagination let us place ourselves in the unprecedented position of the Southerners--their position as regards the millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their midst, for whom some of us now claim the suffrage </s>
<s> Let us be Christians toward our fellow-whites, as well as philanthropists toward the blacks our fellow-men </s>
<s> In all things, and toward all, we are enjoined to do as we would be done by </s>
<s> Nor should we forget that benevolent desires, after passing a certain point, can not undertake their own fulfillment without incurring the risk of evils beyond those sought to be remedied </s>
<s> Something may well be left to the graduated care of future legislation, and to heaven </s>
<s> In one point of view the co-existence of the two races in the South--whether the negro be bond or free--seems (even as it did to Abraham Lincoln) a grave evil </s>
<s> Emancipation has ridded the country of the reproach, but not wholly of the calamity </s>
<s> Especially in the present transition period for both races in the South, more or less of trouble may not unreasonably be anticipated; but let us not hereafter be too swift to charge the blame exclusively in any one quarter </s>
<s> With certain evils men must be more or less patient </s>
<s> Our institutions have a potent digestion, and may in time convert and assimilate to good all elements thrown in, however originally alien </s>
<s> But, so far as immediate measures looking toward permanent Re-establishment are concerned, no consideration should tempt us to pervert the national victory into oppression for the vanquished </s>
<s> Should plausible promise of eventual good, or a deceptive or spurious sense of duty, lead us to essay this, count we must on serious consequences, not the least of which would be divisions among the Northern adherents of the Union </s>
<s> Assuredly, if any honest Catos there be who thus far have gone with us, no longer will they do so, but oppose us, and as resolutely as hitherto they have supported </s>
<s> But this path of thought leads toward those waters of bitterness from which one can only turn aside and be silent </s>
<s> But supposing Re-establishment so far advanced that the Southern seats in Congress are occupied, and by men qualified in accordance with those cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have prevailed in the land--what then </s>
<s> Why the Congressman elected by the people of the South will--represent the people of the South </s>
<s> This may seem a flat conclusion; but in view of the last five years, may there not be latent significance in it </s>
<s> What will be the temper of those Southern members </s>
<s> and, confronted by them, what will be the mood of our own representatives </s>
<s> In private life true reconciliation seldom follows a violent quarrel; but if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable, nice observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new rupture </s>

<s> On the floor of Congress North and South are to come together after a passionate duel, in which the South though proving her valor, has been made to bite the dust </s>
<s> Upon differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged </s>
<s> shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant self-assertion on the other </s>
<s> shall Manassas and Chickamauga be retorted for Chattanooga and Richmond </s>
<s> Under the supposition that the full Congress will be composed of gentlemen, all this is impossible </s>
<s> Yet if otherwise, it needs no prophet of Israel to foretell the end </s>
<s> The maintenance of Congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with the North </s>
<s> Rightly will more forbearance be required from the North than the South, for the North is victor </s>
<s> But some there are who may deem these latter thoughts inapplicable, and for this reason: Since the test-oath opertively excludes from Congress all who in any way participated in Secession, therefore none but Southerners wholly in harmony with the North are eligible to seats </s>
<s> This is true for the time being </s>
<s> But the oath is alterable; and in the wonted fluctuations of parties not improbably it will undergo alteration, assuming such a form, perhaps, as not to bar the admission into the National Legislature of men who represent the populations lately in revolt </s>
<s> Such a result would involve no violation of the principles of democratic government </s>
<s> Not readily can one perceive how the political existence of the millions of late Secessionists can permanently be ignored by this Republic </s>
<s> The years of the war tried our devotion to the Union; the time of peace may test the sincerity of our faith in democracy </s>
<s> In no spirit of opposition, not by way of challenge, is any thing here thrown out </s>
<s> These thoughts are sincere ones; they seem natural --inevitable </s>
<s> Here and there they must have suggested themselves to many thoughtful patriots </s>
<s> And, if they be just thoughts, ere long they must have that weight with the public which already they have had with individuals </s>
<s> For that heroic band--those children of the furnace who, in regions like Texas and Tennessee, maintained their fidelity through terrible trials--we of the North felt for them, and profoundly we honor them </s>
<s> Yet passionate sympathy, with resentments so close as to be almost domestic in their bitterness, would hardly in the present juncture tend to discreet legislation </s>
<s> Were the Unionists and Secessionists but as Guelphs and Ghibellines </s>
<s> If not, then far be it from a great nation now to act in the spirit that animated a triumphant town-faction in the Middle Ages </s>
<s> But crowding thoughts must at last be checked; and, in times like the present, one who desires to be impartially just in the expression of his views, moves as among sword-points presented on every side </s>
<s> Let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy of our time may not have been enacted without instructing our whole beloved country through terror and pity; and may fulfillment verify in the end those expectations which kindle the bards of Progress and Humanity </s>
