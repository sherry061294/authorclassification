<s> How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spreads his claws, And welcomes little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: You are old, Father William] [Music: "You are old, Father William," the young man said, "And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head-- Do you think, at your age, it is right" </s>
<s> "In my youth," Father William replied to his son, "I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why I do it again and again".] [Illustration] "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-- Pray, what is the reason of that" </s>
<s> "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, "I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box-- Allow me to sell you a couple" </s>
<s> "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak-- Pray, how did you manage to do it" </s>
<s> "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life" </s>
<s> "You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balance an eel on the end of your nose-- What made you so awfully clever" </s>
<s> "I have answered three questions, and that is enough," Said his father; "don't give yourself airs </s>
<s> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff </s>
<s> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs" </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Illustration: Twinkle, twinkle, little Bat] [Music: Twinkle, twinkle, little bat </s>
<s> How I wonder what you're at </s>
<s> Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky!] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: Pig and Pepper] [Music: "Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes; He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases" </s>
<s> Wow </s>
<s> Wow </s>
<s> Wow!] "I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases" </s>

<s> said a whiting to a snail, "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail </s>
<s> See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance </s>
<s> They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance </s>
<s> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance </s>
<s> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance"?] [Illustration] "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea" </s>
<s> But the snail replied, "Too far, too far" </s>
<s> and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance </s>
<s> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance </s>
<s> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance </s>
<s> "What matters it how far we go" </s>
<s> his scaly friend replied; "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side </s>
<s> The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, belov√®d snail, but come and join the dance </s>
<s> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance </s>
<s> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance" </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Illustration: 'Tis the Voice of the Lobster] [Music: 'Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare, "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair" </s>
<s> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: Beautiful Soup] [Music: Beautiful soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen </s>
<s> Who for such dainties would not stoop </s>
<s> Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup </s>
<s> Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup </s>

<s> [Illustration] [Transcriber's Note: The hyphen at the end of the third line of the second verse is deliberate in the original, so that "two p-" pronounced as one syllable rhymes with "soup".] [Illustration: The Queen of Hearts] [Music: The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!] [Illustration] [Illustration: Who stole the Tarts] [Music: They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim </s>
<s> He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you?] I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before </s>
<s> If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were </s>
<s> My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it </s>
<s> Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: SONGS FROM THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS] [Illustration] [Illustration: Jabberwocky] [Music: 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe </s>
<s> "Beware the Jabberwock, my son </s>
<s> The jaws that bite, the claws that catch </s>
<s> Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch"!] [Illustration] He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought-- So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought </s>
<s> And as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came </s>
<s> One, two </s>
<s> One, two </s>
<s> And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack </s>
<s> He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back </s>
<s> "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?-- Come to my arms, my beamish boy </s>
<s> O frabjous day </s>
<s> Callooh </s>
<s> Callay" </s>
<s> He chortled in his joy </s>
<s> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Illustration: Tweedledum and Tweedledee] [Music: Tweedledum and Tweedledee Agreed to have a battle; For Tweedledum said Tweedledee Had spoiled his nice new rattle </s>
<s> Just then flew down a monstrous crow, As black as a tar barrel; Which frightened both the heroes so, They quite forgot their quarrel.] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: The Walrus and the Carpenter] [Music: The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might: He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright-- And this was odd, because it was The middle of the night.] The moon was shining sulkily, Because she thought the sun Had got no bus'ness to be there After the day was done-- "It's very rude of him," she said, "To come and spoil the fun" </s>
<s> The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry </s>
<s> You could not see a cloud, because No cloud was in the sky: No birds were flying overhead-- There were no birds to fly </s>
<s> The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand; They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand: "If this were only cleared away," They said, "it would be grand" </s>
<s> "If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose," the Walrus said, "That they could get it clear" </s>
<s> "I doubt it," said the Carpenter, And shed a bitter tear </s>
<s> "O, Oysters, come and walk with us" </s>
<s> The Walrus did beseech, "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, Along the briny beach: We cannot do with more than four, To give a hand to each" </s>
<s> The eldest Oyster looked at him, But never a word he said: The eldest Oyster winked his eye, And shook his heavy head-- Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed </s>
<s> But four young Oysters hurried up, All eager for the treat: Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, Their shoes were clean and neat-- And this was odd, because, you know, They hadn't any feet </s>
<s> Four other Oysters followed them, And yet another four; And thick and fast they came at last, And more, and more, and more-- All hopping through the frothy waves, And scrambling to the shore </s>
<s> [Illustration] The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row </s>
<s> "The time has come," the Walrus said, "To talk of many things: Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax-- Of cabbages--and kings-- And why the sea is boiling hot-- And whether pigs have wings" </s>
<s> "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried, "Before we have our chat; For some of us are out of breath, And all of us are fat" </s>
<s> "No hurry," said the Carpenter: They thanked him much for that </s>
<s> "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said, "Is chiefly what we need: Pepper and vinegar, besides, Are very good indeed-- Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear, We can begin to feed" </s>
<s> "But not on us" </s>
<s> the Oysters cried, Turning a little blue </s>
<s> "After such kindness, that would be A dismal thing to do" </s>
<s> "The night is fine," the Walrus said </s>
<s> "Do you admire the view" </s>
<s> "It was so kind of you to come </s>
<s> And you are very nice" </s>
<s> The Carpenter said nothing, but "Cut us another slice: I wish you were not quite so deaf-- I've had to ask you twice" </s>
<s> "It seems a shame," the Walrus said, "To play them such a trick, After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick" </s>
<s> The Carpenter said nothing, but "The butter's spread too thick" </s>
<s> "I weep for you," the Walrus said: "I deeply sympathize" </s>
<s> With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size, Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes </s>
<s> "Oh, Oysters," said the Carpenter, "You've had a pleasant run </s>
<s> Shall we be trotting home again" </s>
<s> But answer came there none-- And this was scarcely odd, because They'd eaten every one </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Illustration: Humpty Dumpty] [Music: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall: Humpty Dumpty had a great fall </s>
<s> All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: The Message to the Fish] [Music: In winter, when the fields are white, I sing this song for your delight-- In spring, when woods are getting green, I'll try and tell you what I mean </s>
<s> In summer, when the days are long, Perhaps you'll understand the song: In autumn, when the leaves are brown, Take pen and ink, and write it down.] [Illustration] I sent a message to the fish: I told them "This is what I wish" </s>
<s> The little fishes of the sea They sent an answer back to me </s>
<s> The little fishes' answer was "We cannot do it, sir, because--" I sent to them again to say "It will be better to obey" </s>
<s> The fishes answered, with a grin, "Why, what a temper you are in" </s>
<s> I told them once, I told them twice: They would not listen to advice </s>
<s> I took a kettle large and new, Fit for the deed I had to do </s>
<s> My heart went hop, my heart went thump; I filled the kettle at the pump </s>
<s> Then some one came to me, and said, "The little fishes are in bed" </s>
<s> I said to him, I said it plain, "Then you must wake them up again" </s>
<s> I said it very loud and clear; I went and shouted in his ear </s>
<s> But he was very stiff and proud; He said, "You needn't shout so loud" </s>
<s> And he was very proud and stiff; He said, "I'd go and wake them, if--" I took a corkscrew from the shelf: I went to wake them up myself </s>
<s> And when I found the door was locked, I pulled and pushed, and kicked and knocked </s>
<s> And when I found the door was shut, I tried to turn the handle, but-- [Illustration] [Illustration: The Lion and the Unicorn] [Music: The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the Crown: The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town </s>
<s> Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown; Some gave them plum cake, and drummed them out of town.] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: The Aged, Aged Man] [Music: Tune "I give thee all, I can no more," adapted by T </s>
<s> MOORE from H </s>
<s> BISHOP, arranged by L </s>
<s> BROADWOOD </s>
<s> I'll tell thee ev'rything I can; There's little to relate </s>
<s> I saw an aged, aged man, A-sitting on a gate </s>
<s> "Who are you, aged man" </s>
<s> I said </s>
<s> "And how is it you live" </s>
<s> And his answer trickled through my head Like water through a sieve.] He said, "I look for butterflies That sleep among the wheat: I make them into mutton pies, And sell them in the street </s>
<s> I sell them unto men," he said, "Who sail on stormy seas; And that's the way I get my bread-- A trifle, if you please" </s>
<s> But I was thinking of a plan To dye one's whiskers green, And always use so large a fan That they should not be seen </s>
<s> So, having no reply to give To what the old man said, I cried, "Come, tell me how you live" </s>
<s> And thumped him on the head </s>
<s> His accents mild took up the tale: He said "I go my ways, And when I find a mountain rill, I set it in a blaze; And thence they make a stuff they call Rowlands' Macassar Oil-- Yet two-pence-halfpenny is all They give me for my toil" </s>
<s> But I was thinking of a way To feed oneself on batter, And so go on from day to day Getting a little fatter </s>
<s> I shook him well from side to side, Until his face was blue: "Come, tell me how you live," I cried, "And what it is you do" </s>
<s> [Illustration] He said, "I hunt for haddocks' eyes Among the heather bright, And work them into waistcoat-buttons In the silent night </s>
<s> And these I do not sell for gold Or coin of silv'ry shine, But for a copper halfpenny, And that will purchase nine" </s>
<s> "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls, Or set limed twigs for crabs; I sometimes search the grassy knolls For wheels of Hansom-cabs </s>
<s> And that's the way" (he gave a wink) "By which I get my wealth-- And very gladly will I drink Your honour's noble health" </s>
<s> I heard him then, for I had just Completed my design To keep the Menai bridge from rust By boiling it in wine </s>
<s> I thanked him much for telling me The way he got his wealth, But chiefly for his wish that he Might drink my noble health </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Music: And now, if e'er by chance I put My fingers into glue, Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot Into a left-hand shoe, Or if I drop upon my toe A very heavy weight, I weep, for it reminds me so Of that old man I used to know-- Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow, Whose hair was whiter than the snow, Whose face was very like a crow, With eyes, like cinders, all a-glow, Who seem'd distracted with his woe, Who rocked his body to and fro, And muttered mumblingly and low, As if his mouth were full of dough; Who snorted like a buffalo That summer ev'ning, long ago, A-sitting on a gate!] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: Queen Alice] [Music: To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said, "I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head; Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be, Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me"!] Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can, And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran: Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea-- And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three </s>
<s> "Oh, Looking-Glass creatures," quoth Alice, "draw near </s>
<s> 'Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: 'Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me" </s>
<s> Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, Or anything else that is pleasant to drink; Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine-- And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine </s>
<s> [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration: The Fish Riddle] [Music: 1 </s>
<s> "First, the fish must be caught" </s>
<s> That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it </s>
<s> "Next, the fish must be bought" </s>
<s> That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it </s>
<s> "Now, cook me the fish" </s>
<s> That is easy, and will not take more than a minute </s>
<s> "Let it lie in a dish" </s>
<s> That is easy, because it already is in it </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> "Bring it here </s>
<s> Let me sup" </s>
<s> It is easy to set such a dish on the table </s>
<s> "Take the dish-cover up" </s>
<s> Ah, that is so hard that I fear I'm unable </s>
<s> For it holds it like glue-- Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle: Which is easiest to do, Undish-cover the fish, or dish-cover the riddle?] [Illustration] [Illustration: Hush-a-by, Lady] [Music: Hush-a-by, lady, in Alice's lap </s>
<s> Till the feast's ready we've time for a nap: When the feast's over we'll go to the ball-- Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!] [Illustration] </s>
