<s> LONDON _First Published by Methuen & Co </s>
<s> Ltd </s>
<s> in 1922_ _This Edition on handmade paper is limited to 1000 copies_ INTRODUCTORY NOTE The very interesting and richly coloured masque or pantomimic play which is here printed in book form for the first time, was invented sometime in 1894 or possibly a little earlier </s>
<s> It was written, not for publication, but as a personal gift to the author's friend and friend of his family, Mrs Chan Toon, and was sent to her with the letter that follows and explains its origin </s>
<s> Mrs Chan Toon, before her marriage to Mr Chan Toon, a Burmese gentleman, nephew of the King of Burma and a barrister of the Middle Temple, was Miss Mabel Cosgrove, the daughter of Mr Ernest Cosgrove of Lancaster Gate, a friend of Sir William and Lady Wilde, and herself brought up with Oscar and his brother Willie </s>
<s> For a long while Mrs Chan Toon, who after her husband's death became Mrs Woodhouse-Pearse, refused to permit the masque to be printed </s>
<s> The late Robert Ross much wanted to include it in an edition of Wilde's works, of which it now forms a part, but he could not obtain its owner's consent </s>
<s> An arrangement, however, having been completed, the play is now made public </s>
<s> TITE STREET, CHELSEA, _November_ 27, 1894 _My dear Mrs Chan Toon_, _I am greatly repentant being so long in acknowledging receipt of_ "_Told on the Pagoda_" </s>
<s> _I enjoyed reading the stories_, _and much admired their quaint and delicate charm_ </s>
<s> _Burmah calls to me_ </s>
<s> _Under another cover I am sending you a fairy play entitled_ "_For Love of the King_," _just for your own amusement_ </s>
<s> _It is the outcome of long and luminous talks with your distinguished husband in the Temple and on the river_, _in the days when I was meditating writing a novel as beautiful and as intricate as a Persian praying-rug_ </s>
<s> _I hope that I have caught the atmosphere_ </s>
<s> _I should like to see it acted in your Garden House on some night when the sky is a sheet of violet and the stars like women's eyes_ </s>
<s> _Alas_, _it is not likely_ </s>
<s> _I am in the throes of a new comedy_ </s>
<s> _I met a perfectly wonderful person the other day who unconsciously has irradiated my present with sinuous suggestion_: _a Swedish Baron_, _French in manner_, _Athenian in mind_, _and Oriental in morals_ </s>
<s> _His society is a series of revelations_ </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> _I was at Oakley Street on Thursday_; _my mother tells me she sends you a letter nearly every week_ </s>
<s> _Constance desires to be warmly remembered_, _while I_, _who am bathing my brow in the perfume of water-lilies_, _lay myself at the feet of you and yours_ </s>

<s> _Then the elder one comes with a handful of food and proffers it_, _but the peacock does not eat_ </s>
<s> "I shall never understand you, Queen of the Kingdom of Birds," _he says_, _and strokes her feathers_ </s>
<s> _At his touch the plumage scintillates with a brighter_, _a more exquisite sheen_ </s>
<s> _He murmurs to the bird in soft tones and mythical words_ </s>
