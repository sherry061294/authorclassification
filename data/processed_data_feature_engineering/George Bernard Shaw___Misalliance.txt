<s> MISALLIANCE _Johnny Tarleton, an ordinary young business man of thirty or less, is taking his weekly Friday to Tuesday in the house of his father, John Tarleton, who has made a great deal of money out of Tarleton's Underwear </s>
<s> The house is in Surrey, on the slope of Hindhead; and Johnny, reclining, novel in hand, in a swinging chair with a little awning above it, is enshrined in a spacious half hemisphere of glass which forms a pavilion commanding the garden, and, beyond it, a barren but lovely landscape of hill profile with fir trees, commons of bracken and gorse, and wonderful cloud pictures._ _The glass pavilion springs from a bridgelike arch in the wall of the house, through which one comes into a big hall with tiled flooring, which suggests that the proprietor's notion of domestic luxury is founded on the lounges of week-end hotels </s>
<s> The arch is not quite in the centre of the wall </s>
<s> There is more wall to its right than to its left, and this space is occupied by a hat rack and umbrella stand in which tennis rackets, white parasols, caps, Panama hats, and other summery articles are bestowed </s>
<s> Just through the arch at this corner stands a new portable Turkish bath, recently unpacked, with its crate beside it, and on the crate the drawn nails and the hammer used in unpacking </s>
<s> Near the crate are open boxes of garden games: bowls and croquet </s>
<s> Nearly in the middle of the glass wall of the pavilion is a door giving on the garden, with a couple of steps to surmount the hot-water pipes which skirt the glass </s>
<s> At intervals round the pavilion are marble pillars with specimens of Viennese pottery on them, very flamboyant in colour and florid in design </s>
<s> Between them are folded garden chairs flung anyhow against the pipes </s>
<s> In the side walls are two doors: one near the hat stand, leading to the interior of the house, the other on the opposite side and at the other end, leading to the vestibule._ _There is no solid furniture except a sideboard which stands against the wall between the vestibule door and the pavilion, a small writing table with a blotter, a rack for telegram forms and stationery, and a wastepaper basket, standing out in the hall near the sideboard, and a lady's worktable, with two chairs at it, towards the other side of the lounge </s>
<s> The writing table has also two chairs at it </s>
<s> On the sideboard there is a tantalus, liqueur bottles, a syphon, a glass jug of lemonade, tumblers, and every convenience for casual drinking </s>
<s> Also a plate of sponge cakes, and a highly ornate punchbowl in the same style as the keramic display in the pavilion </s>
<s> Wicker chairs and little bamboo tables with ash trays and boxes of matches on them are scattered in all directions </s>
<s> In the pavilion, which is flooded with sunshine, is the elaborate patent swing seat and awning in which Johnny reclines with his novel </s>
<s> There are two wicker chairs right and left of him._ _Bentley Summerhays, one of those smallish, thinskinned youths, who from 17 to 70 retain unaltered the mental airs of the later and the physical appearance of the earlier age, appears in the garden and comes through the glass door into the pavilion </s>
<s> He is unmistakably a grade above Johnny socially; and though he looks sensitive enough, his assurance and his high voice are a little exasperating._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> Hallo </s>
<s> Wheres your luggage </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I left it at the station </s>
<s> Ive walked up from Haslemere </s>
<s> _[He goes to the hat stand and hangs up his hat]._ JOHNNY _[shortly]_ Oh </s>
<s> And who's to fetch it </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Dont know </s>
<s> Dont care </s>
<s> Providence, probably </s>
<s> If not, your mother will have it fetched </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Not her business, exactly, is it </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[returning to the pavilion]_ Of course not </s>
<s> Thats why one loves her for doing it </s>
<s> Look here: chuck away your silly week-end novel, and talk to a chap </s>
<s> After a week in that filthy office my brain is simply blue-mouldy </s>
<s> Lets argue about something intellectual </s>
<s> _[He throws himself into the wicker chair on Johnny's right]._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[straightening up in the swing with a yell of protest]_ No </s>
<s> Now seriously, Bunny, Ive come down here to have a pleasant week-end; and I'm not going to stand your confounded arguments </s>
<s> If you want to argue, get out of this and go over to the Congregationalist minister's </s>
<s> He's a nailer at arguing </s>
<s> He likes it </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> You cant argue with a person when his livelihood depends on his not letting you convert him </s>
<s> And would you mind not calling me Bunny </s>
<s> My name is Bentley Summerhays, which you please </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Whats the matter with Bunny </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> It puts me in a false position </s>
<s> Have you ever considered the fact that I was an afterthought </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> An afterthought </s>
<s> What do you mean by that </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I-- JOHNNY </s>
<s> No, stop: I dont want to know </s>
<s> It's only a dodge to start an argument </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Dont be afraid: it wont overtax your brain </s>
<s> My father was 44 when I was born </s>
<s> My mother was 41 </s>
<s> There was twelve years between me and the next eldest </s>
<s> I was unexpected </s>
<s> I was probably unintentional </s>
<s> My brothers and sisters are not the least like me </s>
<s> Theyre the regular thing that you always get in the first batch from young parents: quite pleasant, ordinary, do-the-regular-thing sort: all body and no brains, like you </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Dont mention it, old chap </s>
<s> Now I'm different </s>
<s> By the time I was born, the old couple knew something </s>
<s> So I came out all brains and no more body than is absolutely necessary </s>
<s> I am really a good deal older than you, though you were born ten years sooner </s>
<s> Everybody feels that when they hear us talk; consequently, though it's quite natural to hear me calling you Johnny, it sounds ridiculous and unbecoming for you to call me Bunny </s>
<s> _[He rises]._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> Does it, by George </s>
<s> You stop me doing it if you can: thats all </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> If you go on doing it after Ive asked you not, youll feel an awful swine </s>
<s> _[He strolls away carelessly to the sideboard with his eye on the sponge cakes]._ At least I should; but I suppose youre not so particular </s>
<s> JOHNNY _[rising vengefully and following Bentley, who is forced to turn and listen]_ I'll tell you what it is, my boy: you want a good talking to; and I'm going to give it to you </s>
<s> If you think that because your father's a K.C.B., and you want to marry my sister, you can make yourself as nasty as you please and say what you like, youre mistaken </s>
<s> Let me tell you that except Hypatia, not one person in this house is in favor of her marrying you; and I dont believe shes happy about it herself </s>
<s> The match isnt settled yet: dont forget that </s>
<s> Youre on trial in the office because the Governor isnt giving his daughter money for an idle man to live on her </s>
<s> Youre on trial here because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the house before she marries him </s>
<s> Thats been going on for two months now; and whats the result </s>
<s> Youve got yourself thoroughly disliked in the office; and youre getting yourself thoroughly disliked here, all through your bad manners and your conceit, and the damned impudence you think clever </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[deeply wounded and trying hard to control himself]_ Thats enough, thank you </s>
<s> You dont suppose, I hope, that I should have come down if I had known that that was how you felt about me </s>
<s> _[He makes for the vestibule door]._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[collaring him]._ No: you dont run away </s>
<s> I'm going to have this out with you </s>
<s> Sit down: d'y' hear </s>
<s> _[Bentley attempts to go with dignity </s>
<s> Johnny slings him into a chair at the writing table, where he sits, bitterly humiliated, but afraid to speak lest he should burst into tears]._ Thats the advantage of having more body than brains, you see: it enables me to teach you manners; and I'm going to do it too </s>
<s> Youre a spoilt young pup; and you need a jolly good licking </s>
<s> And if youre not careful youll get it: I'll see to that next time you call me a swine </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I didnt call you a swine </s>
<s> But _[bursting into a fury of tears]_ you are a swine: youre a beast: youre a brute: youre a cad: youre a liar: youre a bully: I should like to wring your damned neck for you </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[with a derisive laugh]_ Try it, my son </s>
<s> _[Bentley gives an inarticulate sob of rage]._ Fighting isnt in your line </s>
<s> Youre too small and youre too childish </s>
<s> I always suspected that your cleverness wouldnt come to very much when it was brought up against something solid: some decent chap's fist, for instance </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I hope your beastly fist may come up against a mad bull or a prizefighter's nose, or something solider than me </s>
<s> I dont care about your fist; but if everybody here dislikes me-- _[he is checked by a sob]._ Well, I dont care </s>
<s> _[Trying to recover himself]_ I'm sorry I intruded: I didnt know </s>
<s> _[Breaking down again]_ Oh you beast </s>
<s> you pig </s>
<s> Swine, swine, swine, swine, swine </s>
<s> Now </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> All right, my lad, all right </s>
<s> Sling your mud as hard as you please: it wont stick to me </s>
<s> What I want to know is this </s>
<s> How is it that your father, who I suppose is the strongest man England has produced in our time-- BENTLEY </s>
<s> You got that out of your halfpenny paper </s>
<s> A lot you know about him </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> I dont set up to be able to do anything but admire him and appreciate him and be proud of him as an Englishman </s>
<s> If it wasnt for my respect for him, I wouldnt have stood your cheek for two days, let alone two months </s>
<s> But what I cant understand is why he didnt lick it out of you when you were a kid </s>
<s> For twenty-five years he kept a place twice as big as England in order: a place full of seditious coffee-colored heathens and pestilential white agitators in the middle of a lot of savage tribes </s>
<s> And yet he couldnt keep you in order </s>
<s> I dont set up to be half the man your father undoubtedly is; but, by George, it's lucky for you you were not my son </s>
<s> I dont hold with my own father's views about corporal punishment being wrong </s>
<s> It's necessary for some people; and I'd have tried it on you until you first learnt to howl and then to behave yourself </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[contemptuously]_ Yes: behavior wouldnt come naturally to your son, would it </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[stung into sudden violence]_ Now you keep a civil tongue in your head </s>
<s> I'll stand none of your snobbery </s>
<s> I'm just as proud of Tarleton's Underwear as you are of your father's title and his K.C.B., and all the rest of it </s>
<s> My father began in a little hole of a shop in Leeds no bigger than our pantry down the passage there </s>
<s> He-- BENTLEY </s>
<s> Oh yes: I know </s>
<s> Ive read it </s>
<s> "The Romance of Business, or The Story of Tarleton's Underwear </s>
<s> Please Take One" </s>
<s> I took one the day after I first met Hypatia </s>
<s> I went and bought half a dozen unshrinkable vests for her sake </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Well: did they shrink </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Oh, dont be a fool </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Never mind whether I'm a fool or not </s>
<s> Did they shrink </s>
<s> Thats the point </s>
<s> Were they worth the money </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I couldnt wear them: do you think my skin's as thick as your customers' hides </s>
<s> I'd as soon have dressed myself in a nutmeg grater </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Pity your father didnt give your thin skin a jolly good lacing with a cane-- </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Pity you havnt got more than one idea </s>
<s> If you want to know, they did try that on me once, when I was a small kid </s>
<s> A silly governess did it </s>
<s> I yelled fit to bring down the house and went into convulsions and brain fever and that sort of thing for three weeks </s>
<s> So the old girl got the sack; and serve her right </s>
<s> After that, I was let do what I like </s>
<s> My father didnt want me to grow up a broken-spirited spaniel, which is your idea of a man, I suppose </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Jolly good thing for you that my father made you come into the office and shew what you were made of </s>
<s> And it didnt come to much: let me tell you that </s>
<s> When the Governor asked me where I thought we ought to put you, I said, "Make him the Office Boy" </s>
<s> The Governor said you were too green </s>
<s> And so you were </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I daresay </s>
<s> So would you be pretty green if you were shoved into my father's set </s>
<s> I picked up your silly business in a fortnight </s>
<s> Youve been at it ten years; and you havnt picked it up yet </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Dont talk rot, child </s>
<s> You know you simply make me pity you </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> "Romance of Business" indeed </s>
<s> The real romance of Tarleton's business is the story that you understand anything about it </s>
<s> You never could explain any mortal thing about it to me when I asked you </s>
<s> "See what was done the last time": that was the beginning and the end of your wisdom </s>
<s> Youre nothing but a turnspit </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> A what </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> A turnspit </s>
<s> If your father hadnt made a roasting jack for you to turn, youd be earning twenty-four shillings a week behind a counter </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> If you dont take that back and apologize for your bad manners, I'll give you as good a hiding as ever-- BENTLEY </s>
<s> Help </s>
<s> Johnny's beating me </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> Murder </s>
<s> _[He throws himself on the ground, uttering piercing yells]._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> Dont be a fool </s>
<s> Stop that noise, will you </s>
<s> I'm not going to touch you </s>
<s> Sh--sh-- _Hypatia rushes in through the inner door, followed by Mrs Tarleton, and throws herself on her knees by Bentley </s>
<s> Mrs Tarleton, whose knees are stiffer, bends over him and tries to lift him </s>
<s> Mrs Tarleton is a shrewd and motherly old lady who has been pretty in her time, and is still very pleasant and likeable and unaffected </s>
<s> Hypatia is a typical English girl of a sort never called typical: that is, she has an opaque white skin, black hair, large dark eyes with black brows and lashes, curved lips, swift glances and movements that flash out of a waiting stillness, boundless energy and audacity held in leash._ HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[pouncing on Bentley with no very gentle hand]_ Bentley: whats the matter </s>
<s> Dont cry like that: whats the use </s>
<s> Whats happened </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Are you ill, child </s>
<s> _[They get him up.]_ There, there, pet </s>
<s> It's all right: dont cry _[they put him into a chair]_: there </s>
<s> there </s>
<s> there </s>
<s> Johnny will go for the doctor; and he'll give you something nice to make it well </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> What has happened, Johnny </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Was it a wasp </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[impatiently]_ Wasp be dashed </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh Bunny </s>
<s> that was a naughty word </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Yes, I know: I beg your pardon </s>
<s> _[He rises, and extricates himself from them]_ Thats all right </s>
<s> Johnny frightened me </s>
<s> You know how easy it is to hurt me; and I'm too small to defend myself against Johnny </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Johnny: how often have I told you that you must not bully the little ones </s>
<s> I thought youd outgrown all that </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[angrily]_ I do declare, mamma, that Johnny's brutality makes it impossible to live in the house with him </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[deeply hurt]_ It's twenty-seven years, mother, since you had that row with me for licking Robert and giving Hypatia a black eye because she bit me </s>
<s> I promised you then that I'd never raise my hand to one of them again; and Ive never broken my word </s>
<s> And now because this young whelp begins to cry out before he's hurt, you treat me as if I were a brute and a savage </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> No dear, not a savage; but you know you must not call our visitor naughty names </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Oh, let him alone-- JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[fiercely]_ Dont you interfere between my mother and me: d'y' hear </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Johnny's lost his temper, mother </s>
<s> We'd better go </s>
<s> Come, Bentley </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Yes: that will be best </s>
<s> _[To Bentley]_ Johnny doesnt mean any harm, dear: he'll be himself presently </s>
<s> Come </s>
<s> _The two ladies go out through the inner door with Bentley, who turns at the door to grin at Johnny as he goes out._ _Johnny, left alone, clenches his fists and grinds his teeth, but can find no relief in that way for his rage </s>
<s> After choking and stamping for a moment, he makes for the vestibule door </s>
<s> It opens before he reaches it; and Lord Summerhays comes in </s>
<s> Johnny glares at him, speechless </s>
<s> Lord Summerhays takes in the situation, and quickly takes the punchbowl from the sideboard and offers it to Johnny._ LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Smash it </s>
<s> Dont hesitate: it's an ugly thing </s>
<s> Smash it: hard </s>
<s> _[Johnny, with a stifled yell, dashes it in pieces, and then sits down and mops his brow]._ Feel better now </s>
<s> _[Johnny nods]._ I know only one person alive who could drive me to the point of having either to break china or commit murder; and that person is my son Bentley </s>
<s> Was it he </s>
<s> _[Johnny nods again, not yet able to speak]._ As the car stopped I heard a yell which is only too familiar to me </s>
<s> It generally means that some infuriated person is trying to thrash Bentley </s>
<s> Nobody has ever succeeded, though almost everybody has tried </s>
<s> _[He seats himself comfortably close to the writing table, and sets to work to collect the fragments of the punchbowl in the wastepaper basket whilst Johnny, with diminishing difficulty, collects himself]._ Bentley is a problem which I confess I have never been able to solve </s>
<s> He was born to be a great success at the age of fifty </s>
<s> Most Englishmen of his class seem to be born to be great successes at the age of twenty-four at most </s>
<s> The domestic problem for me is how to endure Bentley until he is fifty </s>
<s> The problem for the nation is how to get itself governed by men whose growth is arrested when they are little more than college lads </s>
<s> Bentley doesnt really mean to be offensive </s>
<s> You can always make him cry by telling him you dont like him </s>
<s> Only, he cries so loud that the experiment should be made in the open air: in the middle of Salisbury Plain if possible </s>
<s> He has a hard and penetrating intellect and a remarkable power of looking facts in the face; but unfortunately, being very young, he has no idea of how very little of that sort of thing most of us can stand </s>
<s> On the other hand, he is frightfully sensitive and even affectionate; so that he probably gets as much as he gives in the way of hurt feelings </s>
<s> Youll excuse me rambling on like this about my son </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[who has pulled himself together]_ You did it on purpose </s>
<s> I wasnt quite myself: I needed a moment to pull round: thank you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Not at all </s>
<s> Is your father at home </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> No: he's opening one of his free libraries </s>
<s> Thats another nice little penny gone </s>
<s> He's mad on reading </s>
<s> He promised another free library last week </s>
<s> It's ruinous </s>
<s> Itll hit you as well as me when Bunny marries Hypatia </s>
<s> When all Hypatia's money is thrown away on libraries, where will Bunny come in </s>
<s> Cant you stop him </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I'm afraid not </s>
<s> Hes a perfect whirlwind </s>
<s> Indefatigable at public work </s>
<s> Wonderful man, I think </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Oh, public work </s>
<s> He does too much of it </s>
<s> It's really a sort of laziness, getting away from your own serious business to amuse yourself with other people's </s>
<s> Mind: I dont say there isnt another side to it </s>
<s> It has its value as an advertisement </s>
<s> It makes useful acquaintances and leads to valuable business connections </s>
<s> But it takes his mind off the main chance; and he overdoes it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> The danger of public business is that it never ends </s>
<s> A man may kill himself at it </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Or he can spend more on it than it brings him in: thats how I look at it </s>
<s> What I say is that everybody's business is nobody's business </s>
<s> I hope I'm not a hard man, nor a narrow man, nor unwilling to pay reasonable taxes, and subscribe in reason to deserving charities, and even serve on a jury in my turn; and no man can say I ever refused to help a friend out of a difficulty when he was worth helping </s>
<s> But when you ask me to go beyond that, I tell you frankly I dont see it </s>
<s> I never did see it, even when I was only a boy, and had to pretend to take in all the ideas the Governor fed me up with </s>
<s> I didnt see it; and I dont see it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> There is certainly no business reason why you should take more than your share of the world's work </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> So I say </s>
<s> It's really a great encouragement to me to find you agree with me </s>
<s> For of course if nobody agrees with you, how are you to know that youre not a fool </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Quite so </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> I wish youd talk to him about it </s>
<s> It's no use my saying anything: I'm a child to him still: I have no influence </s>
<s> Besides, you know how to handle men </s>
<s> See how you handled me when I was making a fool of myself about Bunny </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Not at all </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Oh yes I was: I know I was </s>
<s> Well, if my blessed father had come in he'd have told me to control myself </s>
<s> As if I was losing my temper on purpose </s>
<s> _Bentley returns, newly washed </s>
<s> He beams when he sees his father, and comes affectionately behind him and pats him on the shoulders._ BENTLEY </s>
<s> Hel-lo, commander </s>
<s> have you come </s>
<s> Ive been making a filthy silly ass of myself here </s>
<s> I'm awfully sorry, Johnny, old chap: I beg your pardon </s>
<s> Why dont you kick me when I go on like that </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> As we came through Godalming I thought I heard some yelling-- BENTLEY </s>
<s> I should think you did </s>
<s> Johnny was rather rough on me, though </s>
<s> He told me nobody here liked me; and I was silly enough to believe him </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> And all the women have been kissing you and pitying you ever since to stop your crying, I suppose </s>
<s> Baby </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I did cry </s>
<s> But I always feel good after crying: it relieves my wretched nerves </s>
<s> I feel perfectly jolly now </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Not at all ashamed of yourself, for instance </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> If I started being ashamed of myself I shouldnt have time for anything else all my life </s>
<s> I say: I feel very fit and spry </s>
<s> Lets all go down and meet the Grand Cham </s>
<s> _[He goes to the hatstand and takes down his hat]._ LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Does Mr Tarleton like to be called the Grand Cham, do you think, Bentley </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Well, he thinks hes too modest for it </s>
<s> He calls himself Plain John </s>
<s> But you cant call him that in his own office: besides, it doesnt suit him: it's not flamboyant enough </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Flam what </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Flamboyant </s>
<s> Lets go and meet him </s>
<s> Hes telephoned from Guildford to say hes on the road </s>
<s> The dear old son is always telephoning or telegraphing: he thinks hes hustling along like anything when hes only sending unnecessary messages </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Thank you: I should prefer a quiet afternoon </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Right O </s>
<s> I shant press Johnny: hes had enough of me for one week-end </s>
<s> _[He goes out through the pavilion into the grounds]._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> Not a bad idea, that </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> What </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Going to meet the Governor </s>
<s> You know you wouldnt think it; but the Governor likes Bunny rather </s>
<s> And Bunny is cultivating it </s>
<s> I shouldnt be surprised if he thought he could squeeze me out one of these days </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> You dont say so </s>
<s> Young rascal </s>
<s> I want to consult you about him, if you dont mind </s>
<s> Shall we stroll over to the Gibbet </s>
<s> Bentley is too fast for me as a walking companion; but I should like a short turn </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[rising eagerly, highly flattered]_ Right you are </s>
<s> Thatll suit me down to the ground </s>
<s> _[He takes a Panama and stick from the hat stand]._ _Mrs Tarleton and Hypatia come back just as the two men are going out </s>
<s> Hypatia salutes Summerhays from a distance with an enigmatic lift of her eyelids in his direction and a demure nod before she sits down at the worktable and busies herself with her needle </s>
<s> Mrs Tarleton, hospitably fussy, goes over to him._ MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, Lord Summerhays, I didnt know you were here </s>
<s> Wont you have some tea </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> No, thank you: I'm not allowed tea </s>
<s> And I'm ashamed to say Ive knocked over your beautiful punch-bowl </s>
<s> You must let me replace it </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, it doesnt matter: I'm only too glad to be rid of it </s>
<s> The shopman told me it was in the best taste; but when my poor old nurse Martha got cataract, Bunny said it was a merciful provision of Nature to prevent her seeing our china </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[gravely]_ That was exceedingly rude of Bentley, Mrs Tarleton </s>
<s> I hope you told him so </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, bless you </s>
<s> I dont care what he says; so long as he says it to me and not before visitors </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> We're going out for a stroll, mother </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> All right: dont let us keep you </s>
<s> Never mind about that crock: I'll get the girl to come and take the pieces away </s>
<s> _[Recollecting herself]_ There </s>
<s> Ive done it again </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Done what </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Called her the girl </s>
<s> You know, Lord Summerhays, its a funny thing; but now I'm getting old, I'm dropping back into all the ways John and I had when we had barely a hundred a year </s>
<s> You should have known me when I was forty </s>
<s> I talked like a duchess; and if Johnny or Hypatia let slip a word that was like old times, I was down on them like anything </s>
<s> And now I'm beginning to do it myself at every turn </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> There comes a time when all that seems to matter so little </s>
<s> Even queens drop the mask when they reach our time of life </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Let you alone for giving a thing a pretty turn </s>
<s> Youre a humbug, you know, Lord Summerhays </s>
<s> John doesnt know it; and Johnny doesnt know it; but you and I know it, dont we </s>
<s> Now thats something that even you cant answer; so be off with you for your walk without another word </s>
<s> _Lord Summerhays smiles; bows; and goes out through the vestibule door, followed by Johnny </s>
<s> Mrs Tarleton sits down at the worktable and takes out her darning materials and one of her husband's socks </s>
<s> Hypatia is at the other side of the table, on her mother's right </s>
<s> They chat as they work._ HYPATIA </s>
<s> I wonder whether they laugh at us when they are by themselves </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Who </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Bentley and his father and all the toffs in their set </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, thats only their way </s>
<s> I used to think that the aristocracy were a nasty sneering lot, and that they were laughing at me and John </s>
<s> Theyre always giggling and pretending not to care much about anything </s>
<s> But you get used to it: theyre the same to one another and to everybody </s>
<s> Besides, what does it matter what they think </s>
<s> It's far worse when theyre civil, because that always means that they want you to lend them money; and you must never do that, Hypatia, because they never pay </s>
<s> How can they </s>
<s> They dont make anything, you see </s>
<s> Of course, if you can make up your mind to regard it as a gift, thats different; but then they generally ask you again; and you may as well say no first as last </s>
<s> You neednt be afraid of the aristocracy, dear: theyre only human creatures like ourselves after all; and youll hold your own with them easy enough </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, I'm not a bit afraid of them, I assure you </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Well, no, not afraid of them, exactly; but youve got to pick up their ways </s>
<s> You know, dear, I never quite agreed with your father's notion of keeping clear of them, and sending you to a school that was so expensive that they couldnt afford to send their daughters there; so that all the girls belonged to big business families like ourselves </s>
<s> It takes all sorts to make a world; and I wanted you to see a little of all sorts </s>
<s> When you marry Bunny, and go among the women of his father's set, theyll shock you at first </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[incredulously]_ How </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Well, the things they talk about </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> scandalmongering </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh no: we all do that: thats only human nature </s>
<s> But you know theyve no notion of decency </s>
<s> I shall never forget the first day I spent with a marchioness, two duchesses, and no end of Ladies This and That </s>
<s> Of course it was only a committee: theyd put me on to get a big subscription out of John </s>
<s> I'd never heard such talk in my life </s>
<s> The things they mentioned </s>
<s> And it was the marchioness that started it </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> What sort of things </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Drainage! </s>
<s> She'd tried three systems in her castle; and she was going to do away with them all and try another </s>
<s> I didnt know which way to look when she began talking about it: I thought theyd all have got up and gone out of the room </s>
<s> But not a bit of it, if you please </s>
<s> They were all just as bad as she </s>
<s> They all had systems; and each of them swore by her own system </s>
<s> I sat there with my cheeks burning until one of the duchesses, thinking I looked out of it, I suppose, asked me what system I had </s>
<s> I said I was sure I knew nothing about such things, and hadnt we better change the subject </s>
<s> Then the fat was in the fire, I can tell you </s>
<s> There was a regular terror of a countess with an anaerobic system; and she told me, downright brutally, that I'd better learn something about them before my children died of diphtheria </s>
<s> That was just two months after I'd buried poor little Bobby; and that was the very thing he died of, poor little lamb </s>
<s> I burst out crying: I couldnt help it </s>
<s> It was as good as telling me I'd killed my own child </s>
<s> I had to go away; but before I was out of the door one of the duchesses--quite a young woman--began talking about what sour milk did in her inside and how she expected to live to be over a hundred if she took it regularly </s>
<s> And me listening to her, that had never dared to think that a duchess could have anything so common as an inside </s>
<s> I shouldnt have minded if it had been children's insides: we have to talk about them </s>
<s> But grown-up people </s>
<s> I was glad to get away that time </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> There was a physiology and hygiene class started at school; but of course none of our girls were let attend it </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> If it had been an aristocratic school plenty would have attended it </s>
<s> Thats what theyre like: theyve nasty minds </s>
<s> With really nice good women a thing is either decent or indecent; and if it's indecent, we just dont mention it or pretend to know about it; and theres an end of it </s>
<s> But all the aristocracy cares about is whether it can get any good out of the thing </s>
<s> Theyre what Johnny calls cynical-like </s>
<s> And of course nobody can say a word to them for it </s>
<s> Theyre so high up that they can do and say what they like </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, I think they might leave the drains to their husbands </s>
<s> I shouldnt think much of a man that left such things to me </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, dont think that, dear, whatever you do </s>
<s> I never let on about it to you; but it's me that takes care of the drainage here </s>
<s> After what that countess said to me I wasnt going to lose another child or trust John </s>
<s> And I don't want my grandchildren to die any more than my children </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Do you think Bentley will ever be as big a man as his father </s>
<s> I dont mean clever: I mean big and strong </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Not he </s>
<s> Hes overbred, like one of those expensive little dogs </s>
<s> I like a bit of a mongrel myself, whether it's a man or a dog: theyre the best for everyday </s>
<s> But we all have our tastes: whats one woman's meat is another woman's poison </s>
<s> Bunny's a dear little fellow; but I never could have fancied him for a husband when I was your age </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Yes; but he has some brains </s>
<s> Hes not like all the rest </s>
<s> One can't have everything </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, youre quite right, dear: quite right </s>
<s> It's a great thing to have brains: look what it's done for your father </s>
<s> Thats the reason I never said a word when you jilted poor Jerry Mackintosh </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[excusing herself]_ I really couldnt stick it out with Jerry, mother </s>
<s> I know you liked him; and nobody can deny that hes a splendid animal-- MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[shocked]_ Hypatia </s>
<s> How can you </s>
<s> The things that girls say nowadays </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, what else can you call him </s>
<s> If I'd been deaf or he'd been dumb, I could have married him </s>
<s> But living with father, Ive got accustomed to cleverness </s>
<s> Jerry would drive me mad: you know very well hes a fool: even Johnny thinks him a fool </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[up in arms at once in defence of her boy]_ Now dont begin about my Johnny </s>
<s> You know it annoys me </s>
<s> Johnny's as clever as anybody else in his own way </s>
<s> I dont say hes as clever as you in some ways; but hes a man, at all events, and not a little squit of a thing like your Bunny </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, I say nothing against your darling: we all know Johnny's perfection </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Dont be cross, dearie </s>
<s> You let Johnny alone; and I'll let Bunny alone </s>
<s> I'm just as bad as you </s>
<s> There </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, I dont mind your saying that about Bentley </s>
<s> It's true </s>
<s> He is a little squit of a thing </s>
<s> I wish he wasnt </s>
<s> But who else is there </s>
<s> Think of all the other chances Ive had </s>
<s> Not one of them has as much brains in his whole body as Bentley has in his little finger </s>
<s> Besides, theyve no distinction </s>
<s> It's as much as I can do to tell one from the other </s>
<s> They wouldnt even have money if they werent the sons of their fathers, like Johnny </s>
<s> Whats a girl to do </s>
<s> I never met anybody like Bentley before </s>
<s> He may be small; but hes the best of the bunch: you cant deny that </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[with a sigh]_ Well, my pet, if you fancy him, theres no more to be said </s>
<s> _A pause follows this remark: the two women sewing silently._ HYPATIA </s>
<s> Mother: do you think marriage is as much a question of fancy as it used to be in your time and father's </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, it wasnt much fancy with me, dear: your father just wouldnt take no for an answer; and I was only too glad to be his wife instead of his shop-girl </s>
<s> Still, it's curious; but I had more choice than you in a way, because, you see, I was poor; and there are so many more poor men than rich ones that I might have had more of a pick, as you might say, if John hadnt suited me </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I can imagine all sorts of men I could fall in love with; but I never seem to meet them </s>
<s> The real ones are too small, like Bunny, or too silly, like Jerry </s>
<s> Of course one can get into a state about any man: fall in love with him if you like to call it that </s>
<s> But who would risk marrying a man for love </s>
<s> _I_ shouldnt </s>
<s> I remember three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never marry was the man you were in love with, because it would make a perfect slave of you </s>
<s> Theres a sort of instinct against it, I think, thats just as strong as the other instinct </s>
<s> One of them, to my certain knowledge, refused a man she was in love with, and married another who was in love with her; and it turned out very well </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Does all that mean that youre not in love with Bunny </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, how could anybody be in love with Bunny </s>
<s> I like him to kiss me just as I like a baby to kiss me </s>
<s> I'm fond of him; and he never bores me; and I see that hes very clever; but I'm not what you call gone about him, if thats what you mean </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Then why need you marry him </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> What better can I do </s>
<s> I must marry somebody, I suppose </s>
<s> Ive realized that since I was twenty-three </s>
<s> I always used to take it as a matter of course that I should be married before I was twenty </s>
<s> BENTLEY'S VOICE </s>
<s> _[in the garden]_ Youve got to keep yourself fresh: to look at these things with an open mind </s>

<s> _[helping him with the coat]_ Of course youre old </s>
<s> Look at your face and look at mine </s>

<s> Why do we get on so well together </s>

<s> Thats all you know about it, my lad </s>
<s> How do, Patsy </s>
<s> _[Hypatia kisses him]._ How is my Chickabiddy </s>
<s> _[He kisses Mrs Tarleton's hand and poses expansively in the middle of the picture]._ Look at me </s>
<s> Look at these wrinkles, these gray hairs, this repulsive mask that you call old age </s>
<s> What is it </s>
<s> _[Vehemently]_ I ask you, what is it </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Jolly nice and venerable, old man </s>
<s> Dont be discouraged </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Nice </s>
<s> Not a bit of it </s>
<s> Venerable </s>
<s> Venerable be blowed </s>
<s> Read your Darwin, my boy </s>
<s> Read your Weismann </s>
<s> _[He goes to the sideboard for a drink of lemonade]._ MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> For shame, John </s>
<s> Tell him to read his Bible </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[manipulating the syphon]_ Whats the use of telling children to read the Bible when you know they wont </s>
<s> I was kept away from the Bible for forty years by being told to read it when I was young </s>
<s> Then I picked it up one evening in a hotel in Sunderland when I had left all my papers in the train; and I found it wasnt half bad </s>
<s> _[He drinks, and puts down the glass with a smack of enjoyment]._ Better than most halfpenny papers, anyhow, if only you could make people believe it </s>
<s> _[He sits down by the writing-table, near his wife]._ But if you want to understand old age scientifically, read Darwin and Weismann </s>
<s> Of course if you want to understand it romantically, read about Solomon </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Have you had tea, John </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> Dont interrupt me when I'm improving the boy's mind </s>
<s> Where was I </s>
<s> This repulsive mask--Yes </s>
<s> _[Explosively]_ What is death </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Death is a rather unpleasant subject, papa </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Not a bit </s>
<s> Not scientifically </s>
<s> Scientifically it's a delightful subject </s>
<s> You think death's natural </s>
<s> Well, it isnt </s>
<s> You read Weismann </s>
<s> There wasnt any death to start with </s>
<s> You go look in any ditch outside and youll find swimming about there as fresh as paint some of the identical little live cells that Adam christened in the Garden of Eden </s>
<s> But if big things like us didnt die, we'd crowd one another off the face of the globe </s>
<s> Nothing survived, sir, except the sort of people that had the sense and good manners to die and make room for the fresh supplies </s>
<s> And so death was introduced by Natural Selection </s>
<s> You get it out of your head, my lad, that I'm going to die because I'm wearing out or decaying </s>
<s> Theres no such thing as decay to a vital man </s>
<s> I shall clear out; but I shant decay </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> And what about the wrinkles and the almond tree and the grasshopper that becomes a burden and the desire that fails </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Does it </s>
<s> by George </s>
<s> No, sir: it spiritualizes </s>
<s> As to your grasshopper, I can carry an elephant </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> You do say such things, Bunny </s>
<s> What does he mean by the almond tree </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> He means my white hairs: the repulsive mask </s>
<s> That, my boy, is another invention of Natural Selection to disgust young women with me, and give the lads a turn </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> John: I wont have it </s>
<s> Thats a forbidden subject </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> They talk of the wickedness and vanity of women painting their faces and wearing auburn wigs at fifty </s>
<s> But why shouldnt they </s>
<s> Why should a woman allow Nature to put a false mask of age on her when she knows that shes as young as ever </s>
<s> Why should she look in the glass and see a wrinkled lie when a touch of fine art will shew her a glorious truth </s>
<s> The wrinkles are a dodge to repel young men </s>
<s> Suppose she doesnt want to repel young men </s>
<s> Suppose she likes them </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Bunny: take Hypatia out into the grounds for a walk: theres a good boy </s>

<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, never mind me </s>
<s> I'm used to him </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I'm not </s>
<s> I never heard such conversation: I cant believe my ears </s>
<s> And mind you, this is the man who objected to my marrying his daughter on the ground that a marriage between a member of the great and good middle class with one of the vicious and corrupt aristocracy would be a misalliance </s>
<s> A misalliance, if you please </s>
<s> This is the man Ive adopted as a father </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Eh </s>
<s> Whats that </s>
<s> Adopted me as a father, have you </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> Thats an idea of mine </s>
<s> I knew a chap named Joey Percival at Oxford (you know I was two months at Balliol before I was sent down for telling the old woman who was head of that silly college what I jolly well thought of him </s>
<s> He would have been glad to have me back, too, at the end of six months; but I wouldnt go: I just let him want; and serve him right!) Well, Joey was a most awfully clever fellow, and so nice </s>
<s> I asked him what made such a difference between him and all the other pups--they were pups, if you like </s>
<s> He told me it was very simple: they had only one father apiece; and he had three </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Dont talk nonsense, child </s>
<s> How could that be </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Oh, very simple </s>
<s> His father-- TARLETON </s>
<s> Which father </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> The first one: the regulation natural chap </s>
<s> He kept a tame philosopher in the house: a sort of Coleridge or Herbert Spencer kind of card, you know </s>
<s> That was the second father </s>
<s> Then his mother was an Italian princess; and she had an Italian priest always about </s>
<s> He was supposed to take charge of her conscience; but from what I could make out, she jolly well took charge of his </s>
<s> The whole three of them took charge of Joey's conscience </s>
<s> He used to hear them arguing like mad about everything </s>
<s> You see, the philosopher was a freethinker, and always believed the latest thing </s>
<s> The priest didnt believe anything, because it was sure to get him into trouble with someone or another </s>
<s> And the natural father kept an open mind and believed whatever paid him best </s>
<s> Between the lot of them Joey got cultivated no end </s>
<s> He said if he could only have had three mothers as well, he'd have backed himself against Napoleon </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[impressed]_ Thats an idea </s>
<s> Thats a most interesting idea: a most important idea </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> You always were one for ideas, John </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Youre right, Chickabiddy </s>
<s> What do I tell Johnny when he brags about Tarleton's Underwear </s>
<s> It's not the underwear </s>
<s> The underwear be hanged </s>
<s> Anybody can make underwear </s>
<s> Anybody can sell underwear </s>
<s> Tarleton's Ideas: thats whats done it </s>
<s> Ive often thought of putting that up over the shop </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Take me into partnership when you do, old man </s>
<s> I'm wasted on the underwear; but I shall come in strong on the ideas </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> You be a good boy; and perhaps I will </s>

<s> _[scenting a plot against her beloved Johnny]_ Now, John: you promised-- TARLETON </s>

<s> All right, Chickabiddy: dont fuss </s>
<s> Your precious Johnny shant be interfered with </s>
<s> _[Bouncing up, too energetic to sit still]_ But I'm getting sick of that old shop </s>
<s> Thirty-five years Ive had of it: same blessed old stairs to go up and down every day: same old lot: same old game: sorry I ever started it now </s>
<s> I'll chuck it and try something else: something that will give a scope to all my faculties </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Theres money in underwear: theres none in wild-cat ideas </s>

<s> Thats the secret of the successful man </s>
<s> Read Browning </s>
<s> Natural theology on an island, eh </s>
<s> Caliban was afraid to tempt Providence: that was why he was never able to get even with Prospero </s>

<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> I'm no fool, mother, whatever some people may fancy </s>
<s> I dont set up to have as many ideas as the Governor; but what ideas I have are consecutive, at all events </s>
<s> I can think as well as talk </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[to Tarleton, chuckling]_ Had you there, old man, hadnt he </s>
<s> You are rather all over the shop with your ideas, aint you </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[handsomely]_ I'm not saying anything against you, Governor </s>
<s> But I do say that the time has come for sane, healthy, unpretending men like me to make a stand against this conspiracy of the writing and talking and artistic lot to put us in the back row </s>
<s> It isnt a fact that we're inferior to them: it's a put-up job; and it's they that have put the job up </s>
<s> It's we that run the country for them; and all the thanks we get is to be told we're Philistines and vulgar tradesmen and sordid city men and so forth, and that theyre all angels of light and leading </s>
<s> The time has come to assert ourselves and put a stop to their stuck-up nonsense </s>
<s> Perhaps if we had nothing better to do than talking or writing, we could do it better than they </s>
<s> Anyhow, theyre the failures and refuse of business (hardly a man of them that didnt begin in an office) and we're the successes of it </s>
<s> Thank God I havnt failed yet at anything; and I dont believe I should fail at literature if it would pay me to turn my hand to it </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> Hear, hear </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Fancy you writing a book, Johnny </s>
<s> Do you think he could, Lord Summerhays </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Why not </s>
<s> As a matter of fact all the really prosperous authors I have met since my return to England have been very like him </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[again impressed]_ Thats an idea </s>
<s> Thats a new idea </s>
<s> I believe I ought to have made Johnny an author </s>
<s> Ive never said so before for fear of hurting his feelings, because, after all, the lad cant help it; but Ive never thought Johnny worth tuppence as a man of business </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[sarcastic]_ Oh </s>
<s> You think youve always kept that to yourself, do you, Governor </s>
<s> I know your opinion of me as well as you know it yourself </s>
<s> It takes one man of business to appreciate another; and you arnt, and you never have been, a real man of business </s>
<s> I know where Tarleton's would have been three of four times if it hadnt been for me </s>
<s> _[With a snort and a nod to emphasize the implied warning, he retreats to the Turkish bath, and lolls against it with an air of good-humoured indifference]._ TARLETON </s>
<s> Well, who denies it </s>
<s> Youre quite right, my boy </s>
<s> I don't mind confessing to you all that the circumstances that condemned me to keep a shop are the biggest tragedy in modern life </s>
<s> I ought to have been a writer </s>
<s> I'm essentially a man of ideas </s>
<s> When I was a young man I sometimes used to pray that I might fail, so that I should be justified in giving up business and doing something: something first-class </s>
<s> But it was no good: I couldnt fail </s>
<s> I said to myself that if I could only once go to my Chickabiddy here and shew her a chartered accountant's statement proving that I'd made 20 pounds less than last year, I could ask her to let me chance Johnny's and Hypatia's future by going into literature </s>
<s> But it was no good </s>
<s> First it was 250 pounds more than last year </s>
<s> Then it was 700 pounds </s>
<s> Then it was 2000 pounds </s>
<s> Then I saw it was no use: Prometheus was chained to his rock: read Shelley: read Mrs Browning </s>
<s> Well, well, it was not to be </s>
<s> _[He rises solemnly]._ Lord Summerhays: I ask you to excuse me for a few moments </s>
<s> There are times when a man needs to meditate in solitude on his destiny </s>
<s> A chord is touched; and he sees the drama of his life as a spectator sees a play </s>
<s> Laugh if you feel inclined: no man sees the comic side of it more than I </s>
<s> In the theatre of life everyone may be amused except the actor </s>
<s> _[Brightening]_ Theres an idea in this: an idea for a picture </s>
<s> What a pity young Bentley is not a painter </s>
<s> Tarleton meditating on his destiny </s>
<s> Not in a toga </s>
<s> Not in the trappings of the tragedian or the philosopher </s>
<s> In plain coat and trousers: a man like any other man </s>
<s> And beneath that coat and trousers a human soul </s>
<s> Tarleton's Underwear </s>
<s> _[He goes out gravely into the vestibule]._ MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[fondly]_ I suppose it's a wife's partiality, Lord Summerhays; but I do think John is really great </s>
<s> I'm sure he was meant to be a king </s>
<s> My father looked down on John, because he was a rate collector, and John kept a shop </s>
<s> It hurt his pride to have to borrow money so often from John; and he used to console himself by saying, "After all, he's only a linendraper" </s>
<s> But at last one day he said to me, "John is a king" </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> How much did he borrow on that occasion </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[sharply]_ Bentley </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, dont scold the child: he'd have to say something like that if it was to be his last word on earth </s>
<s> Besides, hes quite right: my poor father had asked for his usual five pounds; and John gave him a hundred in his big way </s>
<s> Just like a king </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Not at all </s>
<s> I had five kings to manage in Jinghiskahn; and I think you do your husband some injustice, Mrs Tarleton </s>
<s> They pretended to like me because I kept their brothers from murdering them; but I didnt like them </s>
<s> And I like Tarleton </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Everybody does </s>
<s> I really must go and make the cook do him a Welsh rabbit </s>
<s> He expects one on special occasions </s>
<s> _[She goes to the inner door]._ Johnny: when he comes back ask him where we're to put that new Turkish bath </s>
<s> Turkish baths are his latest </s>
<s> _[She goes out]._ JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[coming forward again]_ Now that the Governor has given himself away, and the old lady's gone, I'll tell you something, Lord Summerhays </s>
<s> If you study men whove made an enormous pile in business without being keen on money, youll find that they all have a slate off </s>
<s> The Governor's a wonderful man; but hes not quite all there, you know </s>
<s> If you notice, hes different from me; and whatever my failings may be, I'm a sane man </s>
<s> Erratic: thats what he is </s>
<s> And the danger is that some day he'll give the whole show away </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Giving the show away is a method like any other method </s>
<s> Keeping it to yourself is only another method </s>
<s> I should keep an open mind about it </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Has it ever occurred to you that a man with an open mind must be a bit of a scoundrel </s>
<s> If you ask me, I like a man who makes up his mind once for all as to whats right and whats wrong and then sticks to it </s>
<s> At all events you know where to have him </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> That may not be his object </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> He may want to have you, old chap </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Well, let him </s>
<s> If a member of my club wants to steal my umbrella, he knows where to find it </s>
<s> If a man put up for the club who had an open mind on the subject of property in umbrellas, I should blackball him </s>
<s> An open mind is all very well in clever talky-talky; but in conduct and in business give me solid ground </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Yes: the quicksands make life difficult </s>
<s> Still, there they are </s>
<s> It's no use pretending theyre rocks </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> I dont know </s>
<s> You can draw a line and make other chaps toe it </s>
<s> Thats what I call morality </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Very true </s>
<s> But you dont make any progress when youre toeing a line </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[suddenly, as if she could bear no more of it]_ Bentley: do go and play tennis with Johnny </s>
<s> You must take exercise </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Do, my boy, do </s>
<s> _[To Johnny]_ Take him out and make him skip about </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[rising reluctantly]_ I promised you two inches more round my chest this summer </s>
<s> I tried exercises with an indiarubber expander; but I wasnt strong enough: instead of my expanding it, it crumpled me up </s>
<s> Come along, Johnny </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Do you no end of good, young chap </s>
<s> _[He goes out with Bentley through the pavilion]._ _Hypatia throws aside her work with an enormous sigh of relief._ LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> At last </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> At last </s>
<s> Oh, if I might only have a holiday in an asylum for the dumb </s>
<s> How I envy the animals </s>
<s> They cant talk </s>
<s> If Johnny could only put back his ears or wag his tail instead of laying down the law, how much better it would be </s>
<s> We should know when he was cross and when he was pleased; and thats all we know now, with all his talk </s>
<s> It never stops: talk, talk, talk, talk </s>
<s> Thats my life </s>
<s> All the day I listen to mamma talking; at dinner I listen to papa talking; and when papa stops for breath I listen to Johnny talking </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> You make me feel very guilty </s>
<s> I talk too, I'm afraid </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, I dont mind that, because your talk is a novelty </s>
<s> But it must have been dreadful for your daughters </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I suppose so </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> If parents would only realize how they bore their children </s>
<s> Three or four times in the last half hour Ive been on the point of screaming </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Were we very dull </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Not at all: you were very clever </s>
<s> Thats whats so hard to bear, because it makes it so difficult to avoid listening </s>
<s> You see, I'm young; and I do so want something to happen </s>
<s> My mother tells me that when I'm her age, I shall be only too glad that nothing's happened; but I'm not her age; so what good is that to me </s>
<s> Theres my father in the garden, meditating on his destiny </s>
<s> All very well for him: hes had a destiny to meditate on; but I havnt had any destiny yet </s>
<s> Everything's happened to him: nothing's happened to me </s>
<s> Thats why this unending talk is so maddeningly uninteresting to me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> It would be worse if we sat in silence </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> No it wouldnt </s>
<s> If you all sat in silence, as if you were waiting for something to happen, then there would be hope even if nothing did happen </s>
<s> But this eternal cackle, cackle, cackle about things in general is only fit for old, old, OLD people </s>
<s> I suppose it means something to them: theyve had their fling </s>
<s> All I listen for is some sign of it ending in something; but just when it seems to be coming to a point, Johnny or papa just starts another hare; and it all begins over again; and I realize that it's never going to lead anywhere and never going to stop </s>
<s> Thats when I want to scream </s>
<s> I wonder how you can stand it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Well, I'm old and garrulous myself, you see </s>
<s> Besides, I'm not here of my own free will, exactly </s>
<s> I came because you ordered me to come </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Didnt you want to come </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> My dear: after thirty years of managing other people's business, men lose the habit of considering what they want or dont want </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, dont begin to talk about what men do, and about thirty years experience </s>
<s> If you cant get off that subject, youd better send for Johnny and papa and begin it all over again </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I'm sorry </s>
<s> I beg your pardon </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I asked you, didnt you want to come </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I did not stop to consider whether I wanted or not, because when I read your letter I knew I had to come </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Why </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Oh come, Miss Tarleton </s>
<s> Really, really </s>
<s> Dont force me to call you a blackmailer to your face </s>
<s> You have me in your power; and I do what you tell me very obediently </s>
<s> Dont ask me to pretend I do it of my own free will </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I dont know what a blackmailer is </s>
<s> I havnt even that much experience </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> A blackmailer, my dear young lady, is a person who knows a disgraceful secret in the life of another person, and extorts money from that other person by threatening to make his secret public unless the money is paid </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I havnt asked you for money </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> No; but you asked me to come down here and talk to you; and you mentioned casually that if I didnt youd have nobody to talk about me to but Bentley </s>
<s> That was a threat, was it not </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, I wanted you to come </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> In spite of my age and my unfortunate talkativeness </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I like talking to you </s>
<s> I can let myself go with you </s>
<s> I can say things to you I cant say to other people </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I wonder why </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, you are the only really clever, grown-up, high-class, experienced man I know who has given himself away to me by making an utter fool of himself with me </s>
<s> You cant wrap yourself up in your toga after that </s>
<s> You cant give yourself airs with me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> You mean you can tell Bentley about me if I do </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Even if there wasnt any Bentley: even if you didnt care (and I really dont see why you should care so much) still, we never could be on conventional terms with one another again </s>
<s> Besides, Ive got a feeling for you: almost a ghastly sort of love for you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[shrinking]_ I beg you--no, please </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, it's nothing at all flattering: and, of course, nothing wrong, as I suppose youd call it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Please believe that I know that </s>
<s> When men of my age-- HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[impatiently]_ Oh, do talk about yourself when you mean yourself, and not about men of your age </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I'll put it as bluntly as I can </s>
<s> When, as you say, I made an utter fool of myself, believe me, I made a poetic fool of myself </s>
<s> I was seduced, not by appetites which, thank Heaven, Ive long outlived: not even by the desire of second childhood for a child companion, but by the innocent impulse to place the delicacy and wisdom and spirituality of my age at the affectionate service of your youth for a few years, at the end of which you would be a grown, strong, formed--widow </s>
<s> Alas, my dear, the delicacy of age reckoned, as usual, without the derision and cruelty of youth </s>
<s> You told me that you didnt want to be an old man's nurse, and that you didnt want to have undersized children like Bentley </s>
<s> It served me right: I dont reproach you: I was an old fool </s>
<s> But how you can imagine, after that, that I can suspect you of the smallest feeling for me except the inevitable feeling of early youth for late age, or imagine that I have any feeling for you except one of shrinking humiliation, I cant understand </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I dont blame you for falling in love with me </s>
<s> I shall be grateful to you all my life for it, because that was the first time that anything really interesting happened to me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Do you mean to tell me that nothing of that kind had ever happened before </s>
<s> that no man had ever-- HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, lots </s>
<s> Thats part of the routine of life here: the very dullest part of it </s>
<s> The young man who comes a-courting is as familiar an incident in my life as coffee for breakfast </s>
<s> Of course, hes too much of a gentleman to misbehave himself; and I'm too much of a lady to let him; and hes shy and sheepish; and I'm correct and self-possessed; and at last, when I can bear it no longer, I either frighten him off, or give him a chance of proposing, just to see how he'll do it, and refuse him because he does it in the same silly way as all the rest </s>
<s> You dont call that an event in one's life, do you </s>
<s> With you it was different </s>
<s> I should as soon have expected the North Pole to fall in love with me as you </s>
<s> You know I'm only a linen-draper's daughter when all's said </s>
<s> I was afraid of you: you, a great man </s>
<s> a lord </s>
<s> and older than my father </s>
<s> And then what a situation it was </s>
<s> Just think of it </s>
<s> I was engaged to your son; and you knew nothing about it </s>
<s> He was afraid to tell you: he brought you down here because he thought if he could throw us together I could get round you because I was such a ripping girl </s>
<s> We arranged it all: he and I </s>
<s> We got Papa and Mamma and Johnny out of the way splendidly; and then Bentley took himself off, and left us--you and me!--to take a walk through the heather and admire the scenery of Hindhead </s>
<s> You never dreamt that it was all a plan: that what made me so nice was the way I was playing up to my destiny as the sweet girl that was to make your boy happy </s>
<s> And then </s>
<s> and then </s>
<s> _[She rises to dance and clap her hands in her glee]._ LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[shuddering]_ Stop, stop </s>
<s> Can no woman understand a man's delicacy </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[revelling in the recollection]_ And then--ha, ha!--you proposed </s>
<s> You </s>
<s> A father </s>
<s> For your son's girl </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Stop, I tell you </s>
<s> Dont profane what you dont understand </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> That was something happening at last with a vengeance </s>
<s> It was splendid </s>
<s> It was my first peep behind the scenes </s>
<s> If I'd been seventeen I should have fallen in love with you </s>
<s> Even as it is, I feel quite differently towards you from what I do towards other old men </s>
<s> So _[offering her hand]_ you may kiss my hand if that will be any fun for you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[rising and recoiling to the table, deeply revolted]_ No, no, no </s>
<s> How dare you </s>
<s> _[She laughs mischievously]._ How callous youth is </s>
<s> How coarse </s>
<s> How cynical </s>
<s> How ruthlessly cruel </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Stuff </s>
<s> It's only that youre tired of a great many things Ive never tried </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> It's not alone that </s>
<s> Ive not forgotten the brutality of my own boyhood </s>
<s> But do try to learn, glorious young beast that you are, that age is squeamish, sentimental, fastidious </s>
<s> If you cant understand my holier feelings, at least you know the bodily infirmities of the old </s>
<s> You know that I darent eat all the rich things you gobble up at every meal; that I cant bear the noise and racket and clatter that affect you no more than they affect a stone </s>
<s> Well, my soul is like that too </s>
<s> Spare it: be gentle with it _[he involuntarily puts out his hands to plead: she takes them with a laugh]._ If you could possibly think of me as half an angel and half an invalid, we should get on much better together </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> We get on very well, I think </s>
<s> Nobody else ever called me a glorious young beast </s>
<s> I like that </s>
<s> Glorious young beast expresses exactly what I like to be </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[extricating his hands and sitting down]_ Where on earth did you get these morbid tastes </s>
<s> You seem to have been well brought up in a normal, healthy, respectable, middle-class family </s>
<s> Yet you go on like the most unwholesome product of the rankest Bohemianism </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Thats just it </s>
<s> I'm fed up with-- LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Horrible expression </s>
<s> Dont </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, I daresay it's vulgar; but theres no other word for it </s>
<s> I'm fed up with nice things: with respectability, with propriety </s>
<s> When a woman has nothing to do, money and respectability mean that nothing is ever allowed to happen to her </s>
<s> I dont want to be good; and I dont want to be bad: I just dont want to be bothered about either good or bad: I want to be an active verb </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> An active verb </s>
<s> Oh, I see </s>
<s> An active verb signifies to be, to do, or to suffer </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Just so: how clever of you </s>
<s> I want to be; I want to do; and I'm game to suffer if it costs that </s>
<s> But stick here doing nothing but being good and nice and ladylike I simply wont </s>
<s> Stay down here with us for a week; and I'll shew you what it means: shew it to you going on day after day, year after year, lifetime after lifetime </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Shew me what </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Girls withering into ladies </s>
<s> Ladies withering into old maids </s>
<s> Nursing old women </s>
<s> Running errands for old men </s>
<s> Good for nothing else at last </s>
<s> Oh, you cant imagine the fiendish selfishness of the old people and the maudlin sacrifice of the young </s>
<s> It's more unbearable than any poverty: more horrible than any regular-right-down wickedness </s>
<s> Oh, home </s>
<s> home </s>
<s> parents </s>
<s> family </s>
<s> duty </s>
<s> how I loathe them </s>
<s> How I'd like to see them all blown to bits </s>
<s> The poor escape </s>
<s> The wicked escape </s>
<s> Well, I cant be poor: we're rolling in money: it's no use pretending we're not </s>
<s> But I can be wicked; and I'm quite prepared to be </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> You think that easy </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, isnt it </s>
<s> Being a man, you ought to know </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> It requires some natural talent, which can no doubt be cultivated </s>
<s> It's not really easy to be anything out of the common </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Anyhow, I mean to make a fight for living </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Living your own life, I believe the Suffragist phrase is </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Living any life </s>
<s> Living, instead of withering without even a gardener to snip you off when youre rotten </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Ive lived an active life; but Ive withered all the same </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> No: youve worn out: thats quite different </s>
<s> And youve some life in you yet or you wouldnt have fallen in love with me </s>
<s> You can never imagine how delighted I was to find that instead of being the correct sort of big panjandrum you were supposed to be, you were really an old rip like papa </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> No, no: not about your father: I really cant bear it </s>
<s> And if you must say these terrible things: these heart-wounding shameful things, at least find something prettier to call me than an old rip </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, what would you call a man proposing to a girl who might be-- LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> His daughter: yes, I know </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I was going to say his granddaughter </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> You always have one more blow to get in </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Youre too sensitive </s>
<s> Did you ever make mud pies when you were a kid--beg pardon: a child </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I hope not </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> It's a dirty job; but Johnny and I were vulgar enough to like it </s>
<s> I like young people because theyre not too afraid of dirt to live </s>
<s> Ive grown out of the mud pies; but I like slang; and I like bustling you up by saying things that shock you; and I'd rather put up with swearing and smoking than with dull respectability; and there are lots of things that would just shrivel you up that I think rather jolly </s>
<s> Now </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Ive not the slightest doubt of it </s>
<s> Dont insist </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> It's not your ideal, is it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Shall I tell you why </s>
<s> Your ideal is an old woman </s>
<s> I daresay shes got a young face; but shes an old woman </s>
<s> Old, old, old </s>
<s> Squeamish </s>
<s> Cant stand up to things </s>
<s> Cant enjoy things: not real things </s>
<s> Always on the shrink </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> On the shrink </s>
<s> Detestable expression </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Bah </s>
<s> you cant stand even a little thing like that </s>
<s> What good are you </s>
<s> Oh, what good are you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Dont ask me </s>
<s> I dont know </s>
<s> I dont know </s>
<s> _Tarleton returns from the vestibule </s>
<s> Hypatia sits down demurely._ HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, papa: have you meditated on your destiny </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[puzzled]_ What </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> my destiny </s>
<s> Gad, I forgot all about it: Jock started a rabbit and put it clean out of my head </s>
<s> Besides, why should I give way to morbid introspection </s>
<s> It's a sign of madness </s>
<s> Read Lombroso </s>
<s> _[To Lord Summerhays]_ Well, Summerhays, has my little girl been entertaining you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> She is a wonderful entertainer </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I think my idea of bringing up a young girl has been rather a success </s>
<s> Dont you listen to this, Patsy: it might make you conceited </s>

<s> Oh yes, if there had only been anything for me to do, any place for me to go, anything I wanted to read </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> There, you see </s>
<s> Shes not satisfied </s>
<s> Restless </s>
<s> Wants things to happen </s>
<s> Wants adventures to drop out of the sky </s>

<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Well, well, off with you </s>
<s> _[To Lord Summerhays]_ Shes active, like me </s>
<s> She actually wanted me to put her into the shop </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, they tell me that the girls there have adventures sometimes </s>
<s> _[She goes out through the inner door]_ TARLETON </s>

<s> _[He sits down between the writing table and the sideboard]._ Difficult question this, of bringing up children </s>
<s> Between ourselves, it has beaten me </s>
<s> I never was so surprised in my life as when I came to know Johnny as a man of business and found out what he was really like </s>
<s> How did you manage with your sons </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Well, I really hadnt time to be a father: thats the plain truth of the matter </s>
<s> Their poor dear mother did the usual thing while they were with us </s>
<s> Then of course, Harrow, Cambridge, the usual routine of their class </s>
<s> I saw very little of them, and thought very little about them: how could I </s>
<s> with a whole province on my hands </s>
<s> They and I are--acquaintances </s>
<s> Not perhaps, quite ordinary acquaintances: theres a sort of--er--I should almost call it a sort of remorse about the way we shake hands (when we do shake hands) which means, I suppose, that we're sorry we dont care more for one another; and I'm afraid we dont meet oftener than we can help </s>
<s> We put each other too much out of countenance </s>
<s> It's really a very difficult relation </s>
<s> To my mind not altogether a natural one </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[impressed, as usual]_ Thats an idea, certainly </s>
<s> I dont think anybody has ever written about that </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Bentley is the only one who was really my son in any serious sense </s>
<s> He was completely spoilt </s>
<s> When he was sent to a preparatory school he simply yelled until he was sent home </s>
<s> Harrow was out of the question; but we managed to tutor him into Cambridge </s>
<s> No use: he was sent down </s>
<s> By that time my work was over; and I saw a good deal of him </s>
<s> But I could do nothing with him--except look on </s>
<s> I should have thought your case was quite different </s>
<s> You keep up the middle-class tradition: the day school and the business training instead of the university </s>
<s> I believe in the day school part of it </s>
<s> At all events, you know your own children </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Do you </s>
<s> I'm not so sure of it </s>
<s> Fact is, my dear Summerhays, once childhood is over, once the little animal has got past the stage at which it acquires what you might call a sense of decency, it's all up with the relation between parent and child </s>
<s> You cant get over the fearful shyness of it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Shyness </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Yes, shyness </s>
<s> Read Dickens </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS _[surprised]_ Dickens! </s>
<s> Of all authors, Charles Dickens </s>
<s> Are you serious </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I dont mean his books </s>
<s> Read his letters to his family </s>
<s> Read any man's letters to his children </s>
<s> Theyre not human </s>
<s> Theyre not about himself or themselves </s>
<s> Theyre about hotels, scenery, about the weather, about getting wet and losing the train and what he saw on the road and all that </s>
<s> Not a word about himself </s>
<s> Forced </s>
<s> Shy </s>
<s> Duty letters </s>
<s> All fit to be published: that says everything </s>
<s> I tell you theres a wall ten feet thick and ten miles high between parent and child </s>
<s> I know what I'm talking about </s>
<s> Ive girls in my employment: girls and young men </s>
<s> I had ideas on the subject </s>
<s> I used to go to the parents and tell them not to let their children go out into the world without instruction in the dangers and temptations they were going to be thrown into </s>
<s> What did every one of the mothers say to me </s>
<s> "Oh, sir, how could I speak of such things to my own daughter" </s>
<s> The men said I was quite right; but they didnt do it, any more than I'd been able to do it myself to Johnny </s>
<s> I had to leave books in his way; and I felt just awful when I did it </s>
<s> Believe me, Summerhays, the relation between the young and the old should be an innocent relation </s>
<s> It should be something they could talk about </s>
<s> Well, the relation between parent and child may be an affectionate relation </s>
<s> It may be a useful relation </s>
<s> It may be a necessary relation </s>
<s> But it can never be an innocent relation </s>
<s> Youd die rather than allude to it </s>
<s> Depend on it, in a thousand years itll be considered bad form to know who your father and mother are </s>
<s> Embarrassing </s>
<s> Better hand Bentley over to me </s>
<s> I can look him in the face and talk to him as man to man </s>
<s> You can have Johnny </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Ive lived so long in a country where a man may have fifty sons, who are no more to him than a regiment of soldiers, that I'm afraid Ive lost the English feeling about it </s>

<s> If I had my life to live over again, I'd stay at home and supercivilize myself </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Nonsense </s>
<s> dont be selfish </s>
<s> Think how youve improved the other chaps </s>
<s> Look at the Spanish empire </s>
<s> Bad job for Spain, but splendid for South America </s>
<s> Look at what the Romans did for Britain </s>

<s> I'll tell you with pleasure </s>
<s> For the last hundred and fifty years, not a single day has passed without some member of my family risking his life--or her life </s>

<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS _[with a sigh]_ Ah yes, yes </s>
<s> It no longer quiets mine, I am sorry to say </s>
<s> LINA </s>
<s> That is because you do not know how to read it </s>

<s> Whats the matter with you </s>
<s> You dont look starved; and youve a decent suit of clothes </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> Forty-two shillings </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> They can do you a very decent suit for forty-two shillings </s>
<s> Have you paid for it </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> Do you take me for a thief </s>
<s> And do you suppose I can get credit like you </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Then you were able to lay your hand on forty-two shillings </s>
<s> Judging from your conversational style, I should think you must spend at least a shilling a week on romantic literature </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> Where would I get a shilling a week to spend on books when I can hardly keep myself decent </s>
<s> I get books at the Free Library </s>
<s> TARLETON _[springing to his feet]_ What!! </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> _[recoiling before his vehemence]_ The Free Library </s>
<s> Theres no harm in that </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Ingrate </s>
<s> I supply you with free books; and the use you make of them is to persuade yourself that it's a fine thing to shoot me </s>

<s> Whats wrong </s>
<s> Are you out of employment </s>

<s> No </s>
<s> This is my Saturday afternoon </s>

<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Well, call away </s>
<s> What have I to account for </s>
<s> Had you a hard time with your mother </s>
<s> Why didnt she ask me for money </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> She'd have died first </s>
<s> Besides, who wanted your money </s>
<s> Do you suppose we lived in the gutter </s>
<s> My father maynt have been in as large a way as you; but he was better connected; and his shop was as respectable as yours </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I suppose your mother brought him a little capital </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> I dont know </s>
<s> Whats that got to do with you </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Well, you say she and I knew one another and parted </s>
<s> She must have had something off me then, you know </s>
<s> One doesnt get out of these things for nothing </s>
<s> Hang it, young man: do you suppose Ive no heart </s>
<s> Of course she had her due; and she found a husband with it, and set him up in business with it, and brought you up respectably; so what the devil have you to complain of </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> Are women to be ruined with impunity </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>

<s> Thats just it: Ive no business to do </s>
<s> Do you know what my life is </s>
<s> I spend my days from nine to six--nine hours of daylight and fresh air--in a stuffy little den counting another man's money </s>
<s> Ive an intellect: a mind and a brain and a soul; and the use he makes of them is to fix them on his tuppences and his eighteenpences and his two pound seventeen and tenpences and see how much they come to at the end of the day and take care that no one steals them </s>
<s> I enter and enter, and add and add, and take money and give change, and fill cheques and stamp receipts; and not a penny of that money is my own: not one of those transactions has the smallest interest for me or anyone else in the world but him; and even he couldnt stand it if he had to do it all himself </s>
<s> And I'm envied: aye, envied for the variety and liveliness of my job, by the poor devil of a bookkeeper that has to copy all my entries over again </s>
<s> Fifty thousand entries a year that poor wretch makes; and not ten out of the fifty thousand ever has to be referred to again; and when all the figures are counted up and the balance sheet made out, the boss isnt a penny the richer than he'd be if bookkeeping had never been invented </s>
<s> Of all the damnable waste of human life that ever was invented, clerking is the very worst </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Why not join the territorials </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> Because I shouldnt be let </s>
<s> He hasnt even the sense to see that it would pay him to get some cheap soldiering out of me </s>
<s> How can a man tied to a desk from nine to six be anything--be even a man, let alone a soldier </s>
<s> But I'll teach him and you a lesson </s>
<s> Ive had enough of living a dog's life and despising myself for it </s>
<s> Ive had enough of being talked down to by hogs like you, and wearing my life out for a salary that wouldnt keep you in cigars </s>
<s> Youll never believe that a clerk's a man until one of us makes an example of one of you </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Despotism tempered by assassination, eh </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> Thats what they do in Russia </s>
<s> Well, a business office is Russia as far as the clerks are concerned </s>
<s> So dont you take it so coolly </s>
<s> You think I'm not going to do it; but I am </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[rising and facing him]_ Come, now, as man to man </s>
<s> It's not my fault that youre poorer than I am; and it's not your fault that I'm richer than you </s>
<s> And if you could undo all that passed between me and your mother, you wouldnt undo it; and neither would she </s>

<s> _[at his right elbow]_ Somebody has come </s>

<s> You cant cover me with that pistol </s>
<s> Try </s>
<s> _He tries, presenting the pistol at her face </s>
<s> She moves round him in the opposite direction to the hands of a clock with a light dancing step </s>

<s> I got four days last August </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> What did you do </s>
<s> THE MAN </s>
<s> I did a cheap trip to Folkestone </s>
<s> I spent sevenpence on dropping pennies into silly automatic machines and peepshows of rowdy girls having a jolly time </s>
<s> I spent a penny on the lift and fourpence on refreshments </s>
<s> That cleaned me out </s>
<s> The rest of the time I was so miserable that I was glad to get back to the office </s>
<s> Now you know </s>
<s> LINA </s>
<s> Come to the gymnasium: I'll teach you how to make a man of yourself </s>

<s> Youve tried to shoot me; but I'm not vindictive </s>
<s> I draw the line at putting a man on the rack </s>
<s> If you want every joint in your body stretched until it's an agony to live--until you have an unnatural feeling that all your muscles are singing and laughing with pain--then go to the gymnasium with that lady </s>
<s> But youll be more comfortable in jail </s>

<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> _[suddenly breaking out aggressively, being incapable of any middle way between submissiveness and violence]_ _I_ can tell you where Hypatia is </s>
<s> I can tell you where Joey is </s>

<s> All right, Chickabiddy: it's not bad language: it's only Socialism </s>

<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Teach away </s>
<s> I never asked to be let off </s>
<s> I'm ashamed to be free instead of taking my part with the rest </s>
<s> Women--beautiful women of noble birth--are going to prison for their opinions </s>

<s> _[much vexed]_ Oh, did you ever hear such silly nonsense </s>
<s> Bunny: go and tell the gardener to send over one of his men to Grayshott for the police </s>

<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> After all, why shouldnt she do it </s>
<s> The Russian students do it </s>
<s> Women should be as free as men </s>
<s> I'm a fool </s>
<s> I'm so full of your bourgeois morality that I let myself be shocked by the application of my own revolutionary principles </s>
<s> If she likes the man why shouldnt she tell him so </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> I do wonder at you, John, letting him talk like this before everybody </s>
<s> _[Turning rather tartly to Lina]_ Would you mind going away to the drawing-room just for a few minutes, Miss Chipenoska </s>

<s> GUNNER _[rising apprehensively and reading in a hardly audible voice, like a very sick man]_ I, John Brown, of 4 Chesterfield Parade, Kentish Town, do hereby voluntarily confess that on the 31st May 1909 I trespassed on the land of John Tarleton at Hindhead, and effected an unlawful entry into his house, where I secreted myself in a portable Turkish bath, with a pistol, with which I threatened to take the life of the said John Tarleton, and was prevented from doing so only by the timely arrival of the celebrated Miss Lena Sh-Sh-sheepanossika </s>
<s> I further confess that I was guilty of uttering an abominable calumny concerning Miss Hypatia Tarleton, for which there was not a shred of foundation </s>
<s> I apologize most humbly to the lady and her family for my conduct; and I promise Mr Tarleton not to repeat it, and to amend my life, and to do what in me lies to prove worthy of his kindness in giving me another chance and refraining from delivering me up to the punishment I so richly deserve </s>
<s> _A short and painful silence follows </s>
<s> Then Percival speaks._ PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Do you consider that sufficient, Lord Summerhays </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Oh quite, quite </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> _[to Hypatia]_ Lord Summerhays would probably like to hear you say that you are satisfied, Miss Tarleton </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[coming out of the swing, and advancing between Percival and Lord Summerhays]_ I must say that you have behaved like a perfect gentleman, Mr Percival </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> _[first bowing to Hypatia, and then turning with cold contempt to Gunner, who is standing helpless]_ We need not trouble you any further </s>
<s> _[Gunner turns vaguely towards the pavilion]._ JOHNNY _[with less refined offensiveness, pointing to the pavilion]_ Thats your way </s>
<s> The gardener will shew you the shortest way into the road </s>
<s> Go the shortest way </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> _[oppressed and disconcerted, hardly knows how to get out of the room]_ Yes, sir </s>
<s> I-- _[He turns again, appealing to Tarleton]_ Maynt I have my mother's photographs back again </s>
<s> _[Mrs Tarleton pricks up her ears]._ TARLETON </s>
<s> Eh </s>
<s> What </s>
<s> Oh, the photographs </s>
<s> Yes, yes, yes: take them </s>
<s> _[Gunner takes them from the table, and is creeping away, when Mrs Tarleton puts out her hand and stops him]._ MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Whats this, John </s>
<s> What were you doing with his mother's photographs </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Nothing, nothing </s>
<s> Never mind, Chickabiddy: it's all right </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[snatching the photographs from Gunner's irresolute fingers, and recognizing them at a glance]_ Lucy Titmus </s>
<s> Oh John, John </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[grimly, to Gunner]_ Young man: youre a fool; but youve just put the lid on this job in a masterly manner </s>
<s> I knew you would </s>
<s> I told you all to let well alone </s>
<s> You wouldnt; and now you must take the consequences--or rather _I_ must take them </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[to Gunner]_ Are you Lucy's son </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> And why didnt you come to me </s>
<s> I didnt turn my back on your mother when she came to me in her trouble </s>
<s> Didnt you know that </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> She never talked to me about anything </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> How could she talk to her own son </s>
<s> Shy, Summerhays, shy </s>
<s> Parent and child </s>
<s> Shy </s>
<s> _[He sits down at the end of the writing table nearest the sideboard like a man resigned to anything that fate may have in store for him]._ MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Then how did you find out </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> From her papers after she died </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> _[shocked]_ Is Lucy dead </s>
<s> And I never knew </s>
<s> _[With an effusion of tenderness]_ And you here being treated like that, poor orphan, with nobody to take your part </s>
<s> Tear up that foolish paper, child; and sit down and make friends with me </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> | Hallo, mother this is all very well, you know-- | PERCIVAL </s>

<s> | Oh, look here, mamma: this is really-- MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Will you please speak one at a time </s>
<s> _Silence._ PERCIVAL _[in a very gentlemanly manner]_ Will you allow me to remind you, Mrs Tarleton, that this man has uttered a most serious and disgraceful falsehood concerning Miss Tarleton and myself </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> I dont believe a word of it </s>
<s> If the poor lad was there in the Turkish bath, who has a better right to say what was going on here than he has </s>
<s> You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Patsy; and so ought you too, Mr Percival, for encouraging her </s>
<s> _[Hypatia retreats to the pavilion, and exchanges grimaces with Johnny, shamelessly enjoying Percival's sudden reverse </s>
<s> They know their mother]._ PERCIVAL </s>
<s> _[gasping]_ Mrs Tarleton: I give you my word of honor-- MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, go along with you and your word of honor </s>
<s> Do you think I'm a fool </s>
<s> I wonder you can look the lad in the face after bullying him and making him sign those wicked lies; and all the time you carrying on with my daughter before youd been half an hour in my house </s>
<s> Fie, for shame </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Lord Summerhays: I appeal to you </s>
<s> Have I done the correct thing or not </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Youve done your best, Mr Percival </s>
<s> But the correct thing depends for its success on everybody playing the game very strictly </s>
<s> As a single-handed game, it's impossible </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[suddenly breaking out lamentably]_ Joey: have you taken Hypatia away from me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[severely]_ Bentley </s>
<s> Bentley </s>
<s> Control yourself, sir </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Come, Mr Percival </s>
<s> the shutters are up on the gentlemanly business </s>
<s> Try the truth </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> I am in a wretched position </s>
<s> If I tell the truth nobody will believe me </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh yes they will </s>
<s> The truth makes everybody believe it </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> It also makes everybody pretend not to believe it </s>
<s> Mrs Tarleton: youre not playing the game </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> I dont think youve behaved at all nicely, Mr Percival </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> I wouldnt have played you such a dirty trick, Joey </s>
<s> _[Struggling with a sob]_ You beast </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Bentley: you must control yourself </s>
<s> Let me say at the same time, Mr Percival, that my son seems to have been mistaken in regarding you either as his friend or as a gentleman </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Miss Tarleton: I'm suffering this for your sake </s>
<s> I ask you just to say that I am not to blame </s>
<s> Just that and nothing more </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[gloating mischievously over his distress]_ You chased me through the heather and kissed me </s>
<s> You shouldnt have done that if you were not in earnest </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Oh, this is really the limit </s>
<s> _[Turning desperately to Gunner]_ Sir: I appeal to you </s>
<s> As a gentleman </s>
<s> as a man of honor </s>
<s> as a man bound to stand by another man </s>
<s> You were in that Turkish bath </s>
<s> You saw how it began </s>
<s> Could any man have behaved more correctly than I did </s>
<s> Is there a shadow of foundation for the accusations brought against me </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> _[sorely perplexed]_ Well, what do you want me to say </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> He has said what he had to say already, hasnt he </s>
<s> Read that paper </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> When I tell the truth, you make me go back on it </s>
<s> And now you want me to go back on myself </s>
<s> What is a man to do </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> _[patiently]_ Please try to get your mind clear, Mr Brown </s>
<s> I pointed out to you that you could not, as a gentleman, disparage a lady's character </s>
<s> You agree with me, I hope </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Yes: that sounds all right </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> But youre also bound to tell the truth </s>
<s> Surely youll not deny that </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Who's denying it </s>
<s> I say nothing against it </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Of course not </s>
<s> Well, I ask you to tell the truth simply and unaffectedly </s>
<s> Did you witness any improper conduct on my part when you were in the bath </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> No, sir </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> | Then what do you mean by saying that-- | HYPATIA </s>
<s> | Do you mean to say that I-- | BENTLEY </s>
<s> | Oh, you are a rotter </s>
<s> Youre afraid-- TARLETON </s>

<s> Enough said </s>
<s> You keep quiet, Johnny </s>
<s> Mr Percival: youre whitewashed </s>
<s> So are you, Patsy </s>
<s> Honors are easy </s>
<s> Lets drop the subject </s>

<s> Now stop joking the poor lad, John: I wont have it </s>
<s> Has been worried to death between you all </s>

<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Tea </s>
<s> No: it's too early </s>
<s> I'm all right; only I had no dinner: I didnt think I'd want it </s>
<s> I didnt think I'd be alive </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, what a thing to say </s>
<s> You mustnt talk like that </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Hes out of his mind </s>
<s> He thinks it's past dinner-time </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, youve no sense, Johnny </s>

<s> _[with unexpected aggressiveness]_ My name isnt Brown </s>

<s> Mister Baker </s>
<s> If any man doubts it, I'm ready for him </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> John: you shouldnt have given him that sloe gin </s>
<s> It's gone to his head </s>

<s> Dont you think it </s>
<s> Fruit beverages dont go to the head; and what matter if they did </s>
<s> I say nothing to you, maam: I regard you with respect and affection </s>
<s> _[Lachrymosely]_ You were very good to my mother: my poor mother </s>
<s> _[Relapsing into his daring mood]_ But I say my name's Baker; and I'm not to be treated as a child or made a slave of by any man </s>
<s> Baker is my name </s>
<s> Did you think I was going to give you my real name </s>
<s> Not likely </s>
<s> Not me </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> So you thought of John Brown </s>
<s> That was clever of you </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Clever </s>
<s> Yes: we're not all such fools as you think: we clerks </s>
<s> It was the bookkeeper put me up to that </s>
<s> It's the only name that nobody gives as a false name, he said </s>
<s> Clever, eh </s>
<s> I should think so </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> Come now, Julius-- GUNNER </s>
<s> _[reassuring her gravely]_ Dont you be alarmed, maam </s>
<s> I know what is due to you as a lady and to myself as a gentleman </s>
<s> I regard you with respect and affection </s>
<s> If you had been my mother, as you ought to have been, I should have had more chance </s>
<s> But you shall have no cause to be ashamed of me </s>
<s> The strength of a chain is no greater than its weakest link; but the greatness of a poet is the greatness of his greatest moment </s>
<s> Shakespear used to get drunk </s>
<s> Frederick the Great ran away from a battle </s>
<s> But it was what they could rise to, not what they could sink to, that made them great </s>
<s> They werent good always; but they were good on their day </s>
<s> Well, on my day--on my day, mind you--I'm good for something too </s>
<s> I know that Ive made a silly exhibition of myself here </s>
<s> I know I didnt rise to the occasion </s>
<s> I know that if youd been my mother, youd have been ashamed of me </s>
<s> I lost my presence of mind: I was a contemptible coward </s>
<s> But _[slapping himself on the chest]_ I'm not the man I was then </s>
<s> This is my day </s>
<s> Ive seen the tenth possessor of a foolish face carried out kicking and screaming by a woman </s>
<s> _[To Percival]_ You crowed pretty big over me </s>
<s> You hypnotized me </s>
<s> But when you were put through the fire yourself, you were found wanting </s>
<s> I tell you straight I dont give a damn for you </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> No: thats naughty </s>
<s> You shouldnt say that before me </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> I would cut my tongue out sooner than say anything vulgar in your presence; for I regard you with respect and affection </s>
<s> I was not swearing </s>
<s> I was affirming my manhood </s>
<s> MRS TARLETON </s>
<s> What an idea </s>
<s> What puts all these things into your head </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Oh, dont you think, because I'm a clerk, that I'm not one of the intellectuals </s>
<s> I'm a reading man, a thinking man </s>
<s> I read in a book--a high class six shilling book--this precept: Affirm your manhood </s>
<s> It appealed to me </s>
<s> Ive always remembered it </s>
<s> I believe in it </s>
<s> I feel I must do it to recover your respect after my cowardly behavior </s>
<s> Therefore I affirm it in your presence </s>
<s> I tell that man who insulted me that I dont give a damn for him </s>
<s> And neither I do </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I say, Summerhays: did you have chaps of this sort in Jinghiskahn </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Oh yes: they exist everywhere: they are a most serious modern problem </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> Youre right </s>
<s> _[Conceitedly]_ I'm a problem </s>
<s> And I tell you that when we clerks realize that we're problems </s>
<s> well, look out: thats all </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[suavely, to Gunner]_ You read a great deal, you say </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Ive read more than any man in this room, if the truth were known, I expect </s>
<s> Thats whats going to smash up your Capitalism </s>
<s> The problems are beginning to read </s>
<s> Ha </s>
<s> We're free to do that here in England </s>
<s> What would you do with me in Jinghiskahn if you had me there </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Well, since you ask me so directly, I'll tell you </s>
<s> I should take advantage of the fact that you have neither sense enough nor strength enough to know how to behave yourself in a difficulty of any sort </s>
<s> I should warn an intelligent and ambitious policeman that you are a troublesome person </s>
<s> The intelligent and ambitious policeman would take an early opportunity of upsetting your temper by ordering you to move on, and treading on your heels until you were provoked into obstructing an officer in the discharge of his duty </s>
<s> Any trifle of that sort would be sufficient to make a man like you lose your self-possession and put yourself in the wrong </s>
<s> You would then be charged and imprisoned until things quieted down </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> And you call that justice </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> Justice was not my business </s>
<s> I had to govern a province; and I took the necessary steps to maintain order in it </s>
<s> Men are not governed by justice, but by law or persuasion </s>
<s> When they refuse to be governed by law or persuasion, they have to be governed by force or fraud, or both </s>
<s> I used both when law and persuasion failed me </s>
<s> Every ruler of men since the world began has done so, even when he has hated both fraud and force as heartily as I do </s>
<s> It is as well that you should know this, my young friend; so that you may recognize in time that anarchism is a game at which the police can beat you </s>
<s> What have you to say to that </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> What have I to say to it </s>
<s> Well, I call it scandalous: thats what I have to say to it </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Precisely: thats all anybody has to say to it, except the British public, which pretends not to believe it </s>
<s> And now let me ask you a sympathetic personal question </s>
<s> Havnt you a headache </s>
<s> GUNNER </s>
<s> Well, since you ask me, I have </s>

<s> The question that occupies all the novel readers and all the playgoers </s>
<s> The question they never get tired of </s>

<s> But what question </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> The question which particular young man some young woman will mate with </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> As if it mattered </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[sharply]_ Whats that you said </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> I said: As if it mattered </s>

<s> Do you care about that </s>
<s> you who are so magnificently unladylike </s>

<s> Oh, shut up, Johnny </s>
<s> I can take care of myself </s>
<s> Dont you interfere </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Oh, very well </s>
<s> If you choose to give yourself away like that--to allow a man to call you unladylike and then to be unladylike, Ive nothing more to say </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I think Mr Percival is most ungentlemanly; but I wont be protected </s>
<s> I'll not have my affairs interfered with by men on pretence of protecting me </s>
<s> I'm not your baby </s>
<s> If I interfered between you and a woman, you would soon tell me to mind my own business </s>

<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Ive nothing more to say; and as I dont seem to be wanted here, I shall take myself off </s>

<s> Cat and dog </s>
<s> Patsy: I'm ashamed of you </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I'll make it up with Johnny afterwards; but I really cant have him here sticking his clumsy hoof into my affairs </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> The question is, Mr Percival, are you really a gentleman, or are you not </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Was Napoleon really a gentleman or was he not </s>
<s> He made the lady get out of the way of the porter and said, "Respect the burden, madam" </s>
<s> That was behaving like a very fine gentleman; but he kicked Volney for saying that what France wanted was the Bourbons back again </s>
<s> That was behaving rather like a navvy </s>
<s> Now I, like Napoleon, am not all one piece </s>
<s> On occasion, as you have all seen, I can behave like a gentleman </s>
<s> On occasion, I can behave with a brutal simplicity which Miss Tarleton herself could hardly surpass </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Gentleman or no gentleman, Patsy: what are your intentions </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> My intentions </s>
<s> Surely it's the gentleman who should be asked his intentions </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Come now, Patsy </s>
<s> none of that nonsense </s>
<s> Has Mr Percival said anything to you that I ought to know or that Bentley ought to know </s>
<s> Have you said anything to Mr Percival </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Mr Percival chased me through the heather and kissed me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> As a gentleman, Mr Percival, what do you say to that </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> As a gentleman, I do not kiss and tell </s>
<s> As a mere man: a mere cad, if you like, I say that I did so at Miss Tarleton's own suggestion </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Beast </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> I dont deny that I enjoyed it </s>

<s> Yes, when she is in pursuit of me </s>
<s> She runs faster and faster </s>
<s> I run slower and slower </s>
<s> And these woods of yours are full of magic </s>
<s> There was a confounded fern owl </s>
<s> Did you ever hear the churr of a fern owl </s>
<s> Did you ever hear it create a sudden silence by ceasing </s>
<s> Did you ever hear it call its mate by striking its wings together twice and whistling that single note that no nightingale can imitate </s>
<s> That is what happened in the woods when I was running away </s>
<s> So I turned; and the pursuer became the pursued </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I had to fight like a wild cat </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Please dont tell us this </s>
<s> It's not fit for old people to hear </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Come: how did it end </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> It's not ended yet </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> How is it going to end </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Ask him </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> How is it going to end, Mr Percival </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> I cant afford to marry, Mr Tarleton </s>
<s> Ive only a thousand a year until my father dies </s>
<s> Two people cant possibly live on that </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, cant they </s>
<s> When _I_ married, I should have been jolly glad to have felt sure of the quarter of it </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> No doubt; but I am not a cheap person, Mr Tarleton </s>
<s> I was brought up in a household which cost at least seven or eight times that; and I am in constant money difficulties because I simply dont know how to live on the thousand a year scale </s>
<s> As to ask a woman to share my degrading poverty, it's out of the question </s>
<s> Besides, I'm rather young to marry </s>
<s> I'm only 28 </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Papa: buy the brute for me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[shrinking]_ My dear Miss Tarleton: dont be so naughty </s>
<s> I know how delightful it is to shock an old man; but there is a point at which it becomes barbarous </s>
<s> Dont </s>
<s> Please dont </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Shall I tell Papa about you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Tarleton: I had better tell you that I once asked your daughter to become my widow </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[to Hypatia]_ Why didnt you accept him, you young idiot </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I was too old </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> All this has been going on under my nose, I suppose </s>
<s> You run after young men; and old men run after you </s>
<s> And I'm the last person in the world to hear of it </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> How could I tell you </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Parents and children, Tarleton </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Oh, the gulf that lies between them </s>
<s> the impassable, eternal gulf </s>
<s> And so I'm to buy the brute for you, eh </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> If you please, papa </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Whats the price, Mr Percival </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> We might do with another fifteen hundred if my father would contribute </s>
<s> But I should like more </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> It's purely a question of money with you, is it </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> _[after a moment's consideration]_ Practically yes: it turns on that </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I thought you might have some sort of preference for Patsy, you know </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Well, but does that matter, do you think </s>
<s> Patsy fascinates me, no doubt </s>
<s> I apparently fascinate Patsy </s>
<s> But, believe me, all that is not worth considering </s>
<s> One of my three fathers (the priest) has married hundreds of couples: couples selected by one another, couples selected by the parents, couples forced to marry one another by circumstances of one kind or another; and he assures me that if marriages were made by putting all the men's names into one sack and the women's names into another, and having them taken out by a blindfolded child like lottery numbers, there would be just as high a percentage of happy marriages as we have here in England </s>
<s> He said Cupid was nothing but the blindfolded child: pretty idea that, I think </s>
<s> I shall have as good a chance with Patsy as with anyone else </s>
<s> Mind: I'm not bigoted about it </s>
<s> I'm not a doctrinaire: not the slave of a theory </s>
<s> You and Lord Summerhays are experienced married men </s>
<s> If you can tell me of any trustworthy method of selecting a wife, I shall be happy to make use of it </s>
<s> I await your suggestions </s>
<s> _[He looks with polite attention to Lord Summerhays, who, having nothing to say, avoids his eye </s>
<s> He looks to Tarleton, who purses his lips glumly and rattles his money in his pockets without a word]._ Apparently neither of you has anything to suggest </s>
<s> Then Patsy will do as well as another, provided the money is forthcoming </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, you beauty, you beauty </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> When I married Patsy's mother, I was in love with her </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> For the first time </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Yes: for the first time </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> For the last time </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> _[revolted]_ Sir: you are in the presence of his daughter </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh, dont mind me </s>
<s> I dont care </s>
<s> I'm accustomed to Papa's adventures </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[blushing painfully]_ Patsy, my child: that was not--not delicate </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, papa, youve never shewn any delicacy in talking to me about my conduct; and I really dont see why I shouldnt talk to you about yours </s>
<s> It's such nonsense </s>
<s> Do you think young people dont know </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> I'm sure they dont feel </s>
<s> Tarleton: this is too horrible, too brutal </s>
<s> If neither of these young people have any--any--any-- PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Shall we say paternal sentimentality </s>
<s> I'm extremely sorry to shock you; but you must remember that Ive been educated to discuss human affairs with three fathers simultaneously </s>
<s> I'm an adult person </s>
<s> Patsy is an adult person </s>
<s> You do not inspire me with veneration </s>
<s> Apparently you do not inspire Patsy with veneration </s>
<s> That may surprise you </s>
<s> It may pain you </s>
<s> I'm sorry </s>
<s> It cant be helped </s>
<s> What about the money </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> You dont inspire me with generosity, young man </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[laughing with genuine amusement]_ He had you there, Joey </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I havnt been a bad father to you, Patsy </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I dont say you have, dear </s>
<s> If only I could persuade you Ive grown up, we should get along perfectly </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Do you remember Bill Burt </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Why </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[to the others]_ Bill Burt was a laborer here </s>
<s> I was going to sack him for kicking his father </s>
<s> He said his father had kicked him until he was big enough to kick back </s>
<s> Patsy begged him off </s>
<s> I asked that man what it felt like the first time he kicked his father, and found that it was just like kicking any other man </s>
<s> He laughed and said that it was the old man that knew what it felt like </s>
<s> Think of that, Summerhays </s>
<s> think of that </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I havnt kicked you, papa </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Youve kicked me harder than Bill Burt ever kicked </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> It's no use, Tarleton </s>
<s> Spare yourself </s>
<s> Do you seriously expect these young people, at their age, to sympathize with what this gentleman calls your paternal sentimentality </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[wistfully]_ Is it nothing to you but paternal sentimentality, Patsy </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Well, I greatly prefer your superabundant vitality, papa </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[violently]_ Hold your tongue, you young devil </s>
<s> The young are all alike: hard, coarse, shallow, cruel, selfish, dirty-minded </s>
<s> You can clear out of my house as soon as you can coax him to take you; and the sooner the better </s>
<s> _[To Percival]_ I think you said your price was fifteen hundred a year </s>
<s> Take it </s>
<s> And I wish you joy of your bargain </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> If you wish to know who I am-- TARLETON </s>
<s> I dont care a tinker's curse who you are or what you are </s>
<s> Youre willing to take that girl off my hands for fifteen hundred a year: thats all that concerns me </s>
<s> Tell her who you are if you like: it's her affair, not mine </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Dont answer him, Joey: it wont last </s>
<s> Lord Summerhays, I'm sorry about Bentley; but Joey's the only man for me </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> It may-- HYPATIA </s>
<s> Please dont say it may break your poor boy's heart </s>
<s> It's much more likely to break yours </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[springing to his feet]_ Leave the room </s>
<s> Do you hear: leave the room </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Arnt we getting a little cross </s>
<s> Dont be angry, Mr Tarleton </s>

<s> Dont you dare make fun of me </s>
<s> Take your aeroplane out of my vinery and yourself out of my house </s>

<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[rising]_ Do </s>
<s> I dine with you </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Did you hear me tell you to leave the room </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> I did </s>
<s> _[To Percival]_ You see what living with one's parents means, Joey </s>
<s> It means living in a house where you can be ordered to leave the room </s>

<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Who pays for it </s>
<s> Go and support yourself as I did if you want to be independent </s>

<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Hold your tongue </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Keep your temper </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> _[coming between them]_ Lord Summerhays: youll join me, I'm sure, in pointing out to both father and daughter that they have now reached that very common stage in family life at which anything but a blow would be an anti-climax </s>
<s> Do you seriously want to beat Patsy, Mr Tarleton </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> I want to thrash the life out of her </s>
<s> If she doesnt get out of my reach, I'll do it </s>
<s> _[He sits down and grasps the writing table to restrain himself]._ HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[coolly going to him and leaning with her breast on his writhing shoulders]_ Oh, if you want to beat me just to relieve your feelings--just really and truly for the fun of it and the satisfaction of it, beat away </s>
<s> I dont grudge you that </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[almost in hysterics]_ I used to think that this sort of thing went on in other families but that it never could happen in ours </s>
<s> And now-- _[He is broken with emotion, and continues lamentably]_ I cant say the right thing </s>
<s> I cant do the right thing </s>
<s> I dont know what is the right thing </s>
<s> I'm beaten; and she knows it </s>
<s> Summerhays: tell me what to do </s>
<s> LORD SUMMERHAYS </s>
<s> When my council in Jinghiskahn reached the point of coming to blows, I used to adjourn the sitting </s>
<s> Let us postpone the discussion </s>
<s> Wait until Monday: we shall have Sunday to quiet down in </s>
<s> Believe me, I'm not making fun of you; but I think theres something in this young gentleman's advice </s>
<s> Read something </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> I'll read King Lear </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Dont </s>
<s> I'm very sorry, dear </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> Youre not </s>
<s> Youre laughing at me </s>
<s> Serve me right </s>
<s> Parents and children </s>
<s> No man should know his own child </s>
<s> No child should know its own father </s>
<s> Let the family be rooted out of civilization </s>
<s> Let the human race be brought up in institutions </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh yes </s>
<s> How jolly </s>
<s> You and I might be friends then; and Joey could stay to dinner </s>

<s> Dont you say I drove him out </s>
<s> Dont you say I drove you out </s>

<s> I really have no right to inflict myself on you </s>
<s> Dropping in as I did-- TARLETON </s>
<s> Out of the sky </s>
<s> Ha </s>
<s> Dropping in </s>
<s> The new sport of aviation </s>
<s> You just see a nice house; drop in; scoop up the man's daughter; and off with you again </s>
<s> _Bentley comes back, with his shoulders hanging as if he too had been exercised to the last pitch of fatigue </s>
<s> He is very sad </s>
<s> They stare at him as he gropes to Percival's chair._ BENTLEY </s>
<s> I'm sorry for making a fool of myself </s>
<s> I beg your pardon </s>
<s> Hypatia: I'm awfully sorry; but Ive made up my mind that I'll never marry </s>
<s> _[He sits down in deep depression]._ HYPATIA </s>
<s> _[running to him]_ How nice of you, Bentley </s>
<s> Of course you guessed I wanted to marry Joey </s>
<s> What did the Polish lady do to you </s>
<s> BENTLEY </s>
<s> _[turning his head away]_ I'd rather not speak of her, if you dont mind </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>

<s> It's beastly of you to laugh </s>

<s> _[on the steps]_ Mr Percival: can we get that aeroplane started again </s>
<s> _[She comes down and runs to the pavilion door]._ I must get out of this into the air: right up into the blue </s>
<s> PERCIVAL </s>
<s> Impossible </s>
<s> The frame's twisted </s>
<s> The petrol has given out: thats what brought us down </s>
<s> And how can we get a clear run to start with among these woods </s>
<s> LINA </s>
<s> _[swooping back through the middle of the pavilion]_ We can straighten the frame </s>
<s> We can buy petrol at the Beacon </s>
<s> With a few laborers we can get her out on to the Portsmouth Road and start her along that </s>
<s> TARLETON </s>
<s> _[rising]_ But why do you want to leave us, Miss Szcz </s>
<s> LINA </s>
<s> Old pal: this is a stuffy house </s>
<s> You seem to think of nothing but making love </s>
<s> All the conversation here is about love-making </s>
<s> All the pictures are about love-making </s>
<s> The eyes of all of you are sheep's eyes </s>
<s> You are steeped in it, soaked in it: the very texts on the walls of your bedrooms are the ones about love </s>
<s> It is disgusting </s>
<s> It is not healthy </s>
<s> Your women are kept idle and dressed up for no other purpose than to be made love to </s>
<s> I have not been here an hour; and already everybody makes love to me as if because I am a woman it were my profession to be made love to </s>
<s> First you, old pal </s>
<s> I forgave you because you were nice about your wife </s>
<s> HYPATIA </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> Oh, papa </s>
<s> LINA </s>
<s> Then you, Lord Summerhays, come to me; and all you have to say is to ask me not to mention that you made love to me in Vienna two years ago </s>
<s> I forgave you because I thought you were an ambassador; and all ambassadors make love and are very nice and useful to people who travel </s>
<s> Then this young gentleman </s>
<s> He is engaged to this young lady; but no matter for that: he makes love to me because I carry him off in my arms when he cries </s>
<s> All these I bore in silence </s>
<s> But now comes your Johnny and tells me I'm a ripping fine woman, and asks me to marry him </s>
<s> I, Lina Szczepanowska, MARRY him!!!! </s>
<s> I do not mind this boy: he is a child: he loves me: I should have to give him money and take care of him: that would be foolish, but honorable </s>
<s> I do not mind you, old pal: you are what you call an old--ouf </s>
<s> but you do not offer to buy me: you say until we are tired--until you are so happy that you dare not ask for more </s>
<s> That is foolish too, at your age; but it is an adventure: it is not dishonorable </s>
<s> I do not mind Lord Summerhays: it was in Vienna: they had been toasting him at a great banquet: he was not sober </s>
<s> That is bad for the health; but it is not dishonorable </s>
<s> But your Johnny </s>
<s> Oh, your Johnny </s>
<s> with his marriage </s>
<s> He will do the straight thing by me </s>
<s> He will give me a home, a position </s>
<s> He tells me I must know that my present position is not one for a nice woman </s>
<s> This to me, Lina Szczepanowska </s>
<s> I am an honest woman: I earn my living </s>
<s> I am a free woman: I live in my own house </s>
<s> I am a woman of the world: I have thousands of friends: every night crowds of people applaud me, delight in me, buy my picture, pay hard-earned money to see me </s>
<s> I am strong: I am skilful: I am brave: I am independent: I am unbought: I am all that a woman ought to be; and in my family there has not been a single drunkard for four generations </s>
<s> And this Englishman </s>
<s> this linendraper </s>
<s> he dares to ask me to come and live with him in this rrrrrrrabbit hutch, and take my bread from his hand, and ask him for pocket money, and wear soft clothes, and be his woman </s>
<s> his wife </s>
<s> Sooner than that, I would stoop to the lowest depths of my profession </s>
<s> I would stuff lions with food and pretend to tame them </s>
<s> I would deceive honest people's eyes with conjuring tricks instead of real feats of strength and skill </s>
<s> I would be a clown and set bad examples of conduct to little children </s>
<s> I would sink yet lower and be an actress or an opera singer, imperilling my soul by the wicked lie of pretending to be somebody else </s>
<s> All this I would do sooner than take my bread from the hand of a man and make him the master of my body and soul </s>
<s> And so you may tell your Johnny to buy an Englishwoman: he shall not buy Lina Szczepanowska; and I will not stay in the house where such dishonor is offered me </s>
<s> Adieu </s>
<s> _[She turns precipitately to go, but is faced in the pavilion doorway by Johnny, who comes in slowly, his hands in his pockets, meditating deeply]._ JOHNNY </s>

<s> I hope you got it as hot as I did </s>

<s> I do not quarrel </s>
<s> You are what is called a chump; but you are not a bad sort of chump </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Well, if a chump may have an opinion, I should put it at this </s>
<s> You make, I suppose, ten pounds a night off your own bat, Miss Lina </s>
<s> LINA </s>

<s> I have made ten pounds a minute </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> _[with increased respect]_ Have you indeed </s>
<s> I didnt know: youll excuse my mistake, I hope </s>
<s> But the principle is the same </s>
<s> Now I trust you wont be offended at what I'm going to say; but Ive thought about this and watched it in daily experience; and you may take it from me that the moment a woman becomes pecuniarily independent, she gets hold of the wrong end of the stick in moral questions </s>
<s> LINA </s>
<s> Indeed </s>
<s> And what do you conclude from that, Mister Johnny </s>
<s> JOHNNY </s>
<s> Well, obviously, that independence for women is wrong and shouldnt be allowed </s>
<s> For their own good, you know </s>
<s> And for the good of morality in general </s>
<s> You agree with me, Lord Summerhays, dont you </s>
