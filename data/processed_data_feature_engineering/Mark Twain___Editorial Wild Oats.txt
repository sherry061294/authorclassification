<s> | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ Editorial Wild Oats My First Literary Venture I was a very smart child at the age of thirteen--an unusually smart child, I thought at the time </s>
<s> It was then that I did my first newspaper scribbling, and most unexpectedly to me it stirred up a fine sensation in the community </s>
<s> It did, indeed, and I was very proud of it, too </s>
<s> I was a printer's "devil," and a progressive and aspiring one </s>
<s> My uncle had me on his paper (the _Weekly Hannibal Journal_, two dollars a year, in advance--five hundred subscribers, and they paid in cord-wood, cabbages, and unmarketable turnips), and on a lucky summer's day he left town to be gone a week, and asked me if I thought I could edit one issue of the paper judiciously </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> didn't I want to try </s>
<s> Higgins was the editor on the rival paper </s>
<s> He had lately been jilted, and one night a friend found an open note on the poor fellow's bed, in which he stated that he could no longer endure life and had drowned himself in Bear Creek </s>
<s> The friend ran down there and discovered Higgins wading back to shore </s>
<s> He had concluded he wouldn't </s>
<s> The village was full of it for several days, but Higgins did not suspect it </s>
<s> I thought this was a fine opportunity </s>
<s> I wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter, and then illustrated it with villanous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wooden type with a jack-knife--one of them a picture of Higgins wading out into the creek in his shirt, with a lantern, sounding the depth of the water with a walking-stick </s>
<s> I thought it was desperately funny, and was densely unconscious that there was any moral obliquity about such a publication </s>
<s> Being satisfied with this effort, I looked around for other worlds to conquer, and it struck me that it would make good, interesting matter to charge the editor of a neighboring country paper with a piece of gratuitous rascality and "see him squirm" </s>
<s> [Illustration: "HE HAD CONCLUDED HE WOULDN'T"] I did it, putting the article into the form of a parody on the "Burial of Sir John Moore"--and a pretty crude parody it was, too </s>
<s> Then I lampooned two prominent citizens outrageously--not because they had done anything to deserve it, but merely because I thought it was my duty to make the paper lively </s>
<s> Next I gently touched up the newest stranger--the lion of the day, the gorgeous journeyman tailor from Quincy </s>
<s> He was a simpering coxcomb of the first water, and the "loudest" dressed man in the State </s>
<s> He was an inveterate woman-killer </s>
<s> Every week he wrote lushy "poetry" for the _Journal_, about his newest conquest </s>
<s> His rhymes for my week were headed, "TO MARY IN H--L," meaning to Mary in Hannibal, of course </s>
<s> But while setting up the piece I was suddenly riven from head to heel by what I regarded as a perfect thunderbolt of humor, and I compressed it into a snappy footnote at the bottom--thus: "We will let this thing pass, just this once; but we wish Mr J </s>
<s> Gordon Runnels to understand distinctly that we have a character to sustain, and from this time forth when he wants to commune with his friends in h--l, he must select some other medium than the columns of this journal" </s>
<s> The paper came out, and I never knew any little thing attract so much attention as those playful trifles of mine </s>
<s> For once the _Hannibal Journal_ was in demand--a novelty it had not experienced before </s>
<s> The whole town was stirred </s>
<s> Higgins dropped in with a double-barrelled shot-gun early in the forenoon </s>
<s> When he found that it was an infant (as he called me) that had done him the damage, he simply pulled my ears and went away; but he threw up his situation that night and left town for good </s>
<s> The tailor came with his goose and a pair of shears; but he despised me, too, and departed for the South that night </s>
<s> The two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel, and went away incensed at my insignificance </s>
<s> The country editor pranced in with a warwhoop next day, suffering for blood to drink; but he ended by forgiving me cordially and inviting me down to the drug-store to wash away all animosity in a friendly bumper of "Fahnestock's Vermifuge" </s>
<s> It was his little joke </s>
<s> My uncle was very angry when he got back--unreasonably so, I thought, considering what an impetus I had given the paper, and considering also that gratitude for his preservation ought to have been uppermost in his mind, inasmuch as by his delay he had so wonderfully escaped dissection, tomahawking, libel, and getting his head shot off </s>
<s> But he softened when he looked at the accounts and saw that I had actually booked the unparalleled number of thirty-three new subscribers, and had the vegetables to show for it--cord-wood, cabbage, beans, and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two years </s>
<s> Journalism in Tennessee The editor of the Memphis _Avalanche_ swoops thus mildly down upon a correspondent who posted him as a Radical: "While he was writing the first word, the middle, dotting his i's, crossing his t's, and punching his period, he knew he was concocting a sentence that was saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehood".--_Exchange_ </s>
<s> I was told by the physician that a Southern climate would improve my health, and so I went down to Tennessee and got a berth on the _Morning-Glory and Johnson County Warwhoop_ as associate editor </s>
<s> When I went on duty I found the chief editor sitting tilted back in a three-legged chair with his feet on a pine table </s>
<s> There was another pine table in the room and another afflicted chair, and both were half buried under newspapers and scraps and sheets of manuscript </s>
<s> There was a wooden box of sand, sprinkled with cigar-stubs and "old soldiers," and a stove with a door hanging by its upper hinge </s>
<s> The chief editor had a long-tailed black cloth frock-coat on, and white linen pants </s>
<s> His boots were small and neatly blacked </s>
<s> He wore a ruffled shirt, a large seal ring, a standing collar of obsolete pattern, and a checkered neckerchief with the ends hanging down </s>
<s> Date of costume about 1848 </s>
<s> He was smoking a cigar, and trying to think of a word, and in pawing his hair he had rumpled his locks a good deal </s>
<s> He was scowling fearfully, and I judged that he was concocting a particularly knotty editorial </s>
<s> He told me to take the exchanges and skim through them and write up the "Spirit of the Tennessee Press," condensing into the article all of their contents that seemed of interest </s>
<s> I wrote as follows: "SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS "The editors of the _Semi-Weekly Earthquake_ evidently labor under a misapprehension with regard to the Ballyhack railroad </s>
<s> It is not the object of the company to leave Buzzardville off to one side </s>
<s> On the contrary, they consider it one of the most important points along the line, and consequently can have no desire to slight it </s>
<s> The gentlemen of the _Earthquake_ will, of course, take pleasure in making the correction </s>
<s> "John W </s>
<s> Blossom, Esq., the able editor of the Higginsville _Thunderbolt and Battle-Cry of Freedom_, arrived in the city yesterday </s>
<s> He is stopping at the Van Buren House </s>
<s> "We observe that our contemporary of the Mud Springs _Morning Howl_ has fallen into the error of supposing that the election of Van Werter is not an established fact, but he will have discovered his mistake before this reminder reaches him, no doubt </s>
<s> He was doubtless misled by incomplete election returns </s>
<s> "It is pleasant to note that the city of Blathersville is endeavoring to contract with some New York gentlemen to pave its wellnigh impassable streets with the Nicholson pavement </s>
<s> The _Daily Hurrah_ urges the measure with ability, and seems confident of ultimate success" </s>
<s> I passed my manuscript over to the chief editor for acceptance, alteration, or destruction </s>
<s> He glanced at it and his face clouded </s>
<s> He ran his eye down the pages, and his countenance grew portentous </s>
<s> It was easy to see that something was wrong </s>
<s> Presently he sprang up and said: "Thunder and lightning </s>
<s> Do you suppose I am going to speak of those cattle that way </s>
<s> Do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such gruel as that </s>
<s> Give me the pen" </s>
<s> I never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously, or plough through another man's verbs and adjectives so relentlessly </s>
<s> While he was in the midst of his work, somebody shot at him through the open window, and marred the symmetry of my ear </s>
<s> "Ah," said he, "that is that scoundrel Smith, of the _Moral Volcano_--he was due yesterday" </s>
<s> And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and fired </s>
<s> Smith dropped, shot in the thigh </s>
<s> The shot spoiled Smith's aim, who was just taking a second chance, and he crippled a stranger </s>
<s> It was me </s>
<s> Merely a finger shot off </s>
<s> Then the chief editor went on with his erasures and interlineations </s>
<s> Just as he finished them a hand-grenade came down the stove-pipe, and the explosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments </s>
<s> However, it did no further damage, except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my teeth out </s>
<s> "That stove is utterly ruined," said the chief editor </s>
<s> I said I believed it was </s>
<s> "Well, no matter--don't want it this kind of weather </s>
<s> I know the man that did it </s>
<s> I'll get him </s>
<s> Now, _here_ is the way this stuff ought to be written" </s>
<s> I took the manuscript </s>
<s> It was scarred with erasures and interlineations till its mother wouldn't have known it if it had had one </s>
<s> It now read as follows: "SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS "The inveterate liars of the _Semi-Weekly Earthquake_ are evidently endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous people another of their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to that most glorious conception of the nineteenth century, the Ballyhack railroad </s>
<s> The idea that Buzzardville was to be left off at one side originated in their own fulsome brains--or rather in the settlings which _they_ regard as brains </s>
<s> They had better swallow this lie if they want to save their abandoned reptile carcasses the cowhiding they so richly deserve </s>
<s> "That ass, Blossom, of the Higginsville _Thunderbolt and Battle-Cry of Freedom_, is down here again sponging at the Van Buren </s>
<s> "We observe that the besotted blackguard of the Mud Springs _Morning Howl_ is giving out, with his usual propensity for lying, that Van Werter is not elected </s>
<s> The heaven-born mission of journalism is to disseminate truth: to eradicate error; to educate, refine, and elevate the tone of public morals and manners, and make all men more gentle, more virtuous, more charitable, and in all ways better, and holier, and happier; and yet this black-hearted scoundrel degrades his great office persistently to the dissemination of falsehood, calumny, vituperation, and vulgarity </s>
<s> "Blathersville wants a Nicholson pavement--it wants a jail and a poor-house more </s>
<s> The idea of a pavement in a one-horse town composed of two gin-mills, a blacksmith-shop, and that mustard-plaster of a newspaper, the _Daily Hurrah_ </s>
<s> The crawling insect, Buckner, who edits the _Hurrah_, is braying about this business with his customary imbecility, and imagining that he is talking sense" </s>
<s> "Now _that_ is the way to write--peppery and to the point </s>
<s> Mush-and-milk journalism gives me the fan-tods" </s>
<s> About this time a brick came through the window with a splintering crash, and gave me a considerable of a jolt in the back </s>
<s> I moved out of range--I began to feel in the way </s>
<s> The chief said: "That was the Colonel, likely </s>
<s> I've been expecting him for two days </s>
<s> He will be up now right away" </s>
<s> He was correct </s>
<s> The Colonel appeared in the door a moment afterwards with a dragoon revolver in his hand </s>
<s> He said: "Sir, have I the honor of addressing the poltroon who edits this mangy sheet" </s>
<s> "You have </s>
<s> Be seated, sir </s>
<s> Be careful of the chair, one of its legs is gone </s>
<s> I believe I have the honor of addressing the putrid liar, Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh" </s>
<s> "Right, sir </s>
<s> I have a little account to settle with you </s>
<s> If you are at leisure we will begin" </s>
<s> "I have an article on the 'Encouraging Progress of Moral and Intellectual Development in America' to finish, but there is no hurry </s>
<s> Begin" </s>
<s> Both pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the same instant </s>
<s> The chief lost a lock of his hair, and the Colonel's bullet ended its career in the fleshy part of my thigh </s>
<s> The Colonel's left shoulder was clipped a little </s>
<s> They fired again </s>
<s> Both missed their men this time, but I got my share, a shot in the arm </s>
<s> At the third fire both gentlemen were wounded slightly, and I had a knuckle chipped </s>
<s> I then said I believed I would go out and take a walk, as this was a private matter, and I had a delicacy about participating in it further </s>
<s> But both gentlemen begged me to keep my seat, and assured me that I was not in the way </s>
<s> They then talked about the elections and the crops while they reloaded, and I fell to tying up my wounds </s>
<s> But presently they opened fire again with animation, and every shot took effect--but it is proper to remark that five out of the six fell to my share </s>
<s> The sixth one mortally wounded the Colonel, who remarked, with fine humor, that he would have to say good-morning now, as he had business up-town </s>
<s> He then inquired the way to the undertaker's and left </s>
<s> The chief turned to me and said: "I am expecting company to dinner, and shall have to get ready </s>
<s> It will be a favor to me if you will read proof and attend to the customers" </s>
<s> I winced a little at the idea of attending to the customers, but I was too bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to think of anything to say </s>
<s> He continued: "Jones will be here at three--cowhide him </s>
<s> Gillespie will call earlier, perhaps--throw him out of the window </s>
<s> Ferguson will be along about four--kill him </s>
<s> That is all for to-day, I believe </s>
<s> If you have any odd time, you may write a blistering article on the police--give the chief inspector rats </s>
<s> The cowhides are under the table; weapons in the drawer--ammunition there in the corner--lint and bandages up there in the pigeon-holes </s>
<s> In case of accident, go to Lancet, the surgeon, down-stairs </s>
<s> He advertises--we take it out in trade" </s>
<s> [Illustration: "GILLESPIE HAD CALLED"] He was gone </s>
<s> I shuddered </s>
<s> At the end of the next three hours I had been through perils so awful that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were gone from me </s>
<s> Gillespie had called and thrown _me_ out of the window </s>
<s> Jones arrived promptly, and when I got ready to do the cowhiding he took the job off my hands </s>
<s> In an encounter with a stranger, not in the bill of fare, I had lost my scalp </s>
<s> Another stranger, by the name of Thompson, left me a mere wreck and ruin of chaotic rags </s>
<s> And at last, at bay in the corner, and beset by an infuriated mob of editors, blacklegs, politicians, and desperadoes, who raved and swore and flourished their weapons about my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes of steel, I was in the act of resigning my berth on the paper when the chief arrived, and with him a rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends </s>
<s> Then ensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human pen, or steel one either, could describe </s>
<s> People were shot, probed, dismembered, blown up, thrown out of the window </s>
<s> There was a brief tornado of murky blasphemy, with a confused and frantic war-dance glimmering through it, and then all was over </s>
<s> In five minutes there was silence, and the gory chief and I sat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin that strewed the floor around us </s>
<s> He said: "You'll like this place when you get used to it" </s>
<s> I said: "I'll have to get you to excuse me; I think maybe I might write to suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some practice and learned the language I am confident I could </s>
<s> But, to speak the plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption </s>
<s> You see that yourself </s>
<s> Vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the public, no doubt, but then I do not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth </s>
<s> I can't write with comfort when I am interrupted so much as I have been to-day </s>
<s> I like this berth well enough, but I don't like to be left here to wait on the customers </s>
<s> The experiences are novel, I grant you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they are not judiciously distributed </s>
<s> A gentleman shoots at you through the window and cripples _me_; a bomb-shell comes down the stove-pipe for your gratification and sends the stove-door down _my_ throat; a friend drops in to swap compliments with you, and freckles _me_ with bullet-holes till my skin won't hold my principles; you go to dinner, and Jones comes with his cowhide, Gillespie throws me out of the window, Thompson tears all my clothes off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom of an old acquaintance; and in less than five minutes all the blackguards in the country arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the rest of me to death with their tomahawks </s>
<s> Take it altogether, I never had such a spirited time in all my life as I have had to-day </s>
<s> No; I like you, and I like your calm, unruffled way of explaining things to the customers, but you see I am not used to it </s>
<s> The Southern heart is too impulsive; Southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger </s>
<s> The paragraphs which I have written to-day, and into whose cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of Tennessean journalism, will wake up another nest of hornets </s>
<s> All that mob of editors will come--and they will come hungry, too, and want somebody for breakfast </s>
<s> I shall have to bid you adieu </s>
<s> I decline to be present at these festivities </s>
<s> I came South for my health; I will go back on the same errand, and suddenly </s>
<s> Tennessean journalism is too stirring for me" </s>
<s> After which we parted with mutual regret, and I took apartments at the hospital </s>
<s> Nicodemus Dodge--Printer When I was a boy in a printing-office in Missouri, a loose-jointed, long-legged, tow-headed, jeans-clad, countrified cub of about sixteen lounged in one day, and without removing his hands from the depths of his trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat, whose broken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bug-eaten cabbage-leaf, stared indifferently around, then leaned his hip against the editors' table, crossed his mighty brogans, aimed at a distant fly from a crevice in his upper teeth, laid him low, and said, with composure: "Whar's the boss" </s>
<s> "I am the boss," said the editor, following this curious bit of architecture wonderingly along up to its clock-face with his eye </s>
<s> "Don't want anybody fur to learn the business, 'tain't likely" </s>
<s> "Well, I don't know </s>
<s> Would you like to learn it" </s>
<s> "Pap's so po' he cain't run me no mo', so I want to git a show somers if I kin, 'tain't no diffunce what--I'm strong and hearty, and I don't turn my back on no kind of work, hard nur soft" </s>
<s> "Do you think you would like to learn the printing business" </s>
<s> "Well, I don't re'ly k'yer a durn what I _do_ learn, so's I git a chance fur to make my way </s>
<s> I'd jist as soon learn print'n' 's anything" </s>
<s> "Can you read" </s>
<s> "Yes--middlin'" </s>
<s> "Write" </s>
<s> "Well, I've seed people could lay over me thar" </s>
<s> "Cipher" </s>
<s> "Not good enough to keep store, I don't reckon, but up as fur as twelve-times-twelve I ain't no slouch </s>
<s> 'Tother side of that is what gits me" </s>
<s> "Where is your home" </s>
<s> "I'm f'm old Shelby" </s>
<s> "What's your father's religious denomination" </s>
<s> "Him </s>
<s> Oh, he's a blacksmith" </s>
<s> "No, no--I don't mean his trade </s>
<s> What's his _religious_ denomination" </s>
<s> "_Oh_--I didn't understand you befo' </s>
<s> He's a Freemason" </s>
<s> "No, no; you don't get my meaning yet </s>

<s> "But suppose he did spell it with a little g--what then" </s>
<s> "Well, if he done it a-purpose, I reckon he wouldn't stand no chance,--he _oughtn't_ to have no chance, anyway, I'm most rotten certain 'bout that" </s>
<s> "What is your name" </s>
<s> "Nicodemus Dodge" </s>
<s> "I think maybe you'll do, Nicodemus </s>
<s> We'll give you a trial, anyway" </s>
<s> "All right" </s>
<s> "When would you like to begin" </s>
<s> "Now" </s>
<s> So, within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he was one of us, and with his coat off and hard at it </s>
<s> Beyond that end of our establishment which was farthest from the street was a deserted garden, pathless, and thickly grown with the bloomy and villanous "jimpson" weed and its common friend the stately sunflower </s>
<s> In the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little "frame" house with but one room, one window, and no ceiling--it had been a smoke-house a generation before </s>
<s> Nicodemus was given this lonely and ghostly den as a bedchamber </s>
<s> The village smarties recognized a treasure in Nicodemus right away--a butt to play jokes on </s>
<s> It was easy to see that he was inconceivably green and confiding </s>
<s> George Jones had the glory of perpetrating the first joke on him; he gave him a cigar with a fire-cracker in it and winked to the crowd to come; the thing exploded presently and swept away the bulk of Nicodemus's eyebrows and eyelashes </s>
<s> He simply said: "I consider them kind of seeg'yars dangersome"--and seemed to suspect nothing </s>
<s> The next evening Nicodemus waylaid George and poured a bucket of ice-water over him </s>
<s> One day, while Nicodemus was in swimming, Tom McElroy "tied" his clothes </s>
<s> Nicodemus made a bonfire of Tom's by way of retaliation </s>
<s> A third joke was played upon Nicodemus a day or two later--he walked up the middle aisle of the village church, Sunday night, with a staring hand-bill pinned between his shoulders </s>
<s> The joker spent the remainder of the night, after church, in the cellar of a deserted house, and Nicodemus sat on the cellar door till towards breakfast-time to make sure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made some rough treatment would be the consequence </s>
<s> The cellar had two feet of stagnant water in it, and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud </s>
<s> But I wander from the point </s>
<s> It was the subject of skeletons that brought this boy back to my recollection </s>
<s> Before a very long time had elapsed, the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable consciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their attempts on the simpleton from "old Shelby" </s>
<s> Experimenters grew scarce and chary </s>
<s> Now the young doctor came to the rescue </s>
<s> There was delight and applause when he proposed to scare Nicodemus to death, and explained how he was going to do it </s>
<s> He had a noble new skeleton--the skeleton of the late and only local celebrity, Jimmy Finn, the village drunkard--a grisly piece of property which he had bought of Jimmy Finn himself, at auction, for fifty dollars, under great competition, when Jimmy lay very sick in the tanyard a fortnight before his death </s>
<s> The fifty dollars had gone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of ownership in the skeleton </s>
<s> The doctor would put Jimmy Finn's skeleton in Nicodemus's bed </s>
<s> This was done--about half-past ten in the evening </s>
<s> About Nicodemus's usual bedtime--midnight--the village jokers came creeping stealthily through the jimpson weeds and sunflowers towards the lonely frame den </s>
<s> They reached the window and peeped in </s>
<s> There sat the long-legged pauper, on his bed, in a very short shirt, and nothing more; he was dangling his legs contentedly back and forth, and wheezing the music of "Camptown Races" out of a paper-overlaid comb which he was pressing against his mouth; by him lay a new jews-harp, a new top, a solid india-rubber ball, a handful of painted marbles, five pounds of "store" candy, and a well-knawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of sheet music </s>
<s> He had sold the skeleton to a travelling quack for three dollars and was enjoying the result </s>
<s> [Illustration: "WHEEZING THE MUSIC OF 'CAMPTOWN RACES'"] Mr Bloke's Item Our esteemed friend, Mr John William Bloke, of Virginia City, walked into the office where we are sub-editor at a late hour last night, with an expression of profound and heartfelt suffering upon his countenance, and, sighing heavily, laid the following item reverently upon the desk, and walked slowly out again </s>
<s> He paused a moment at the door, and seemed struggling to command his feelings sufficiently to enable him to speak, and then, nodding his head towards his manuscript, ejaculated in a broken voice, "Friend of mine--oh </s>
<s> how sad" </s>
<s> and burst into tears </s>
<s> We were so moved at his distress that we did not think to call him back and endeavor to comfort him until he was gone, and it was too late </s>
<s> The paper had already gone to press, but knowing that our friend would consider the publication of this item important, and cherishing the hope that to print it would afford a melancholy satisfaction to his sorrowing heart, we stopped the press at once and inserted it in our columns: DISTRESSING ACCIDENT.--Last evening, about six o'clock, as Mr William Schuyler, an old and respectable citizen of South Park, was leaving his residence to go down-town, as has been his usual custom for many years with the exception only of a short interval in the spring of 1850, during which he was confined to his bed by injuries received in attempting to stop a runaway horse by thoughtlessly placing himself directly in its wake and throwing up his hands and shouting, which, if he had done so even a single moment sooner, must inevitably have frightened the animal still more instead of checking its speed, although disastrous enough to himself as it was, and rendered more melancholy and distressing by reason of the presence of his wife's mother, who was there and saw the sad occurrence, notwithstanding it is at least likely, though not necessarily so, that she should be reconnoitring in another direction when incidents occur, not being vivacious and on the lookout, as a general thing, but even the reverse, as her own mother is said to have stated, who is no more, but died in the full hope of a glorious resurrection, upward of three years ago, aged eighty-six, being a Christian woman and without guile, as it were, or property, in consequence of the fire of 1849, which destroyed every single thing she had in the world </s>
<s> But such is life </s>
<s> Let us all take warning by this solemn occurrence, and let us endeavor so to conduct ourselves that when we come to die we can do it </s>
<s> Let us place our hands upon our heart, and say with earnestness and sincerity that from this day forth we will beware of the intoxicating bowl.--_First edition of the Californian._ The head editor has been in here raising the mischief, and tearing his hair and kicking the furniture about, and abusing me like a pickpocket </s>
<s> He says that every time he leaves me in charge of the paper for half an hour, I get imposed upon by the first infant or the first idiot that comes along </s>
<s> And he says that that distressing item of Mr Bloke's is nothing but a lot of distressing bosh, and has no point to it, and no sense in it, and no information in it, and that there was no sort of necessity for stopping the press to publish it </s>

<s> Considering the elaborate circumstantiality of detail observable in the item, it seems to me that it ought to contain more information than it does </s>

<s> Was the breaking of Mr Schuyler's leg, fifteen years ago, the "distressing accident" that plunged Mr Bloke into unspeakable grief, and caused him to come up here at dead of night and stop our press to acquaint the world with the circumstance </s>

<s> Or did it consist in the death of that person herself three years ago (albeit it does not appear that she died by accident) </s>
<s> In a word, what _did_ that "distressing accident" consist in </s>
<s> What did that drivelling ass of a Schuyler stand _in the wake_ of a runaway horse for, with his shouting and gesticulating, if he wanted to stop him </s>

<s> It is not stated that Schuyler drank, or that his wife drank, or that his mother-in-law drank, or that the horse drank--wherefore, then, the reference to the intoxicating bowl </s>
<s> It does seem to me that if Mr Bloke had let the intoxicating bowl alone himself, he never would have got into so much trouble about this exasperating imaginary accident </s>

<s> I said I was </s>
<s> "Have you ever edited an agricultural paper before" </s>
<s> "No," I said; "this is my first attempt" </s>
<s> "Very likely </s>
<s> Have you had any experience in agriculture practically" </s>
<s> "No; I believe I have not" </s>
<s> "Some instinct told me so," said the old gentleman, putting on his spectacles, and looking over them at me with asperity, while he folded his paper into a convenient shape </s>
<s> "I wish to read you what must have made me have that instinct </s>
<s> It was this editorial </s>
<s> Listen, and see if it was you that wrote it: "Turnips should never be pulled, it injures them </s>
<s> It is much better to send a boy up and let him shake the tree" </s>
<s> "Now, what do you think of that--for I really suppose you wrote it" </s>
<s> "Think of it </s>
<s> Why, I think it is good </s>

<s> Then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds, and stamped on them, and broke several things with his cane, and said I did not know as much as a cow; and then went out and banged the door after him, and, in short, acted in such a way that I fancied he was displeased about something </s>
<s> But not knowing what the trouble was, I could not be any help to him </s>

<s> The Killing of Julius Cæsar "Localized" _Being the only true and reliable account ever published; taken from the "Roman Daily Evening Fasces," of the date of that tremendous occurrence._ Nothing in the world affords a newspaper reporter so much satisfaction as gathering up the details of a bloody and mysterious murder, and writing them up with aggravating circumstantiality </s>
<s> He takes a living delight in this labor of love--for such it is to him, especially if he knows that all the other papers have gone to press, and his will be the only one that will contain the dreadful intelligence </s>
<s> A feeling of regret has often come over me that I was not reporting in Rome when Cæsar was killed--reporting on an evening paper, and the only one in the city, and getting at least twelve hours ahead of the morning-paper boys with this most magnificent "item" that ever fell to the lot of the craft </s>
<s> Other events have happened as startling as this, but none that possessed so peculiarly all the characteristics of the favorite "item" of the present day, magnified into grandeur and sublimity by the high rank, fame, and social and political standing of the actors in it </s>
<s> However, as I was not permitted to report Cæsar's assassination in the regular way, it has at least afforded me rare satisfaction to translate the following able account of it from the original Latin of the _Roman Daily Evening Fasces_ of that date--second edition </s>
<s> "Our usually quiet city of Rome was thrown into a state of wild excitement yesterday by the occurrence of one of those bloody affrays which sicken the heart and fill the soul with fear, while they inspire all thinking men with forebodings for the future of a city where human life is held so cheaply, and the gravest laws are so openly set at defiance </s>
<s> As the result of that affray, it is our painful duty, as public journalists, to record the death of one of our most esteemed citizens--a man whose name is known wherever this paper circulates, and whose fame it has been our pleasure and our privilege to extend, and also to protect from the tongue of slander and falsehood, to the best of our poor ability </s>
<s> We refer to Mr J </s>
<s> Cæsar, the Emperor-elect </s>
<s> "The facts of the case, as nearly as our reporter could determine them from the conflicting statements of eyewitnesses, were about as follows:--The affair was an election row, of course </s>
<s> Nine-tenths of the ghastly butcheries that disgrace the city nowadays grow out of the bickerings and jealousies and animosities engendered by these accursed elections </s>
<s> Rome would be the gainer by it if her very constables were elected to serve a century; for in our experience we have never even been able to choose a dog-pelter without celebrating the event with a dozen knockdowns and a general cramming of the station-house with drunken vagabonds overnight </s>
<s> It is said that when the immense majority for Cæsar at the polls in the market was declared the other day, and the crown was offered to that gentleman, even his amazing unselfishness in refusing it three times was not sufficient to save him from the whispered insults of such men as Casca, of the Tenth Ward, and other hirelings of the disappointed candidate, hailing mostly from the Eleventh and Thirteenth and other outside districts, who were overheard speaking ironically and contemptuously of Mr Cæsar's conduct upon that occasion </s>
<s> "We are further informed that there are many among us who think they are justified in believing that the assassination of Julius Cæsar was a put-up thing--a cut-and-dried arrangement, hatched by Marcus Brutus and a lot of his hired roughs, and carried out only too faithfully according to the programme </s>
<s> Whether there be good grounds for this suspicion or not, we leave to the people to judge for themselves, only asking that they will read the following account of the sad occurrence carefully and dispassionately before they render that judgment </s>
<s> "The Senate was already in session, and Cæsar was coming down the street towards the Capitol, conversing with some personal friends, and followed, as usual, by a large number of citizens </s>
<s> Just as he was passing in front of Demosthenes & Thucydides' drug-store, he was observing casually to a gentleman, who, our informant thinks, is a fortune-teller, that the Ides of March were come </s>
<s> The reply was, 'Yes, they are come, but not gone yet' </s>
<s> At this moment Artemidorus stepped up and passed the time of day, and asked Cæsar to read a schedule or a tract or something of the kind, which he had brought for his perusal </s>
<s> Mr Decius Brutus also said something about an 'humble suit' which _he_ wanted read </s>
<s> Artemidorus begged that attention might be paid to his first, because it was of personal consequence to Cæsar </s>
<s> The latter replied that what concerned himself should be read last, or words to that effect </s>
<s> Artemidorus begged and beseeched him to read the paper instantly.[1] However, Cæsar shook him off, and refused to read any petition in the street </s>
<s> He then entered the Capitol, and the crowd followed him </s>
<s> "About this time the following conversation was overheard, and we consider that, taken in connection with the events which succeeded it, it bears an appalling significance: Mr Papilius Lena remarked to George W </s>
<s> Cassius (commonly known as the 'Nobby Boy of the Third Ward'), a bruiser in the pay of the Opposition, that he hoped his enterprise to-day might thrive; and when Cassius asked, 'What enterprise' </s>
<s> he only closed his left eye temporarily and said with simulated indifference, 'Fare you well,' and sauntered towards Cæsar </s>
<s> Marcus Brutus, who is suspected of being the ringleader of the band that killed Cæsar, asked what it was that Lena had said </s>
<s> Cassius told him, and added, in a low tone, '_I fear our purpose is discovered._' "Brutus told his wretched accomplice to keep an eye on Lena, and a moment after Cassius urged that lean and hungry vagrant, Casca, whose reputation here is none of the best, to be sudden for _he feared prevention_ </s>
<s> He then turned to Brutus, apparently much excited, and asked what should be done, and swore that either he or Cæsar _should never turn back_--he would kill himself first </s>
<s> At this time Cæsar was talking to some of the back-country members about the approaching fall elections, and paying little attention to what was going on around him </s>
<s> Billy Trebonius got into conversation with the people's friend and Cæsar's--Mark Antony--and under some pretence or other got him away, and Brutus, Decius, Casca, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and others of the gang of infamous desperadoes that infest Rome at present, closed around the doomed Cæsar </s>
<s> Then Metellus Cimber knelt down and begged that his brother might be recalled from banishment, but Cæsar rebuked him for his fawning conduct, and refused to grant his petition </s>
<s> Immediately, at Cimber's request, first Brutus and then Cassius begged for the return of the banished Publius; but Cæsar still refused </s>
<s> He said he could not be moved; that he was as fixed as the North Star, and proceeded to speak in the most complimentary terms of the firmness of that star and its steady character </s>
<s> Then he said he was like it, and he believed he was the only man in the country that was; therefore, since he was 'constant' that Cimber should be banished, he was also 'constant' that he should stay banished, and he'd be hanged if he didn't keep him so </s>
<s> "Instantly seizing upon this shallow pretext for a fight, Casca sprang at Cæsar and struck him with a dirk </s>
<s> Cæsar grabbing him by the arm with his right hand, and launching a blow straight from the shoulder with his left that sent the reptile bleeding to the earth </s>
<s> He then backed up against Pompey's statue, and squared himself to receive his assailants </s>
<s> Cassius and Cimber and Cinna rushed upon him with their daggers drawn, and the former succeeded in inflicting a wound upon his body; but before he could strike again, and before either of the others could strike at all, Cæsar stretched the three miscreants at his feet with as many blows of his powerful fist </s>
<s> By this time the Senate was in an indescribable uproar; the throng of citizens in the lobbies had blockaded the doors in their frantic efforts to escape from the building, the sergeant-at-arms and his assistants were struggling with the assassins, venerable senators had cast aside their encumbering robes, and were leaping over benches and flying down the aisles in wild confusion towards the shelter of the committee-rooms, and a thousand voices were shouting 'Po-lice </s>
<s> Po-lice' </s>
<s> in discordant tones that rose above the frightful din like shrieking winds above the roaring of a tempest </s>
<s> And amid it all, great Cæsar stood with his back against the statue, like a lion at bay, and fought his assailants weaponless and hand to hand, with the defiant bearing and the unwavering courage which he had shown before on many a bloody field </s>
<s> Billy Trebonius and Caius Legarius struck him with their daggers and fell, as their brother-conspirators before them had fallen </s>
<s> But at last, when Cæsar saw his old friend Brutus step forward armed with a murderous knife, it is said he seemed utterly overpowered with grief and amazement, and dropping his invincible left arm by his side, he hid his face in the folds of his mantle and received the treacherous blow without an effort to stay the hand that gave it </s>
<s> He only said, '_Et tu, Brute?_' and fell lifeless on the marble pavement </s>
<s> "We learn that the coat deceased had on when he was killed was the same one he wore in his tent on the afternoon of the day he overcame the Nervii, and that when it was removed from the corpse it was found to be cut and gashed in no less than seven different places </s>
