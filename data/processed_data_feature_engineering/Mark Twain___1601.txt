<s> 1601 Conversation as it was by the Social Fireside in the Time of the Tudors By Mark Twain INTRODUCTION "Born irreverent," scrawled Mark Twain on a scratch pad, "--like all other people I have ever known or heard of--I am hoping to remain so while there are any reverent irreverences left to make fun of" </s>
<s> --[Holograph manuscript of Samuel L </s>
<s> Clemens, in the collection of the F </s>
<s> J </s>
<s> Meine] Mark Twain was just as irreverent as he dared be, and 1601 reveals his richest expression of sovereign contempt for overstuffed language, genteel literature, and conventional idiocies </s>
<s> Later, when a magazine editor apostrophized, "O that we had a Rabelais" </s>
<s> Mark impishly and anonymously--submitted 1601; and that same editor, a praiser of Rabelais, scathingly abused it and the sender </s>
<s> In this episode, as in many others, Mark Twain, the "bad boy" of American literature, revealed his huge delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy </s>
<s> Too, there was always the spirit of Tom Sawyer deviltry in Mark's make-up that prompted him, as he himself boasted, to see how much holy indignation he could stir up in the world </s>
<s> WHO WROTE 1601 </s>
<s> The correct and complete title of 1601, as first issued, was: [Date, 1601.] 'Conversation, as it was by the Social Fireside, in the Time of the Tudors' </s>
<s> For many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880, its authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed </s>
<s> In Boston, William T </s>
<s> Ball, one of the leading theatrical critics during the late 90's, asserted that it was originally written by an English actor (name not divulged) who gave it to him </s>
<s> Ball's original, it was said, looked like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed, and may indeed have been a proof pulled in some newspaper office </s>
<s> In St </s>
<s> Louis, William Marion Reedy, editor of the St </s>
<s> Louis Mirror, had seen this famous tour de force circulated in the early 80's in galley-proof form; he first learned from Eugene Field that it was from the pen of Mark Twain </s>
<s> "Many people," said Reedy, "thought the thing was done by Field and attributed, as a joke, to Mark Twain </s>
<s> Field had a perfect genius for that sort of thing, as many extant specimens attest, and for that sort of practical joke; but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too mellow--not hard and bright and bitter--to be Eugene Field's" </s>
<s> Reedy's opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great humorists; one half suspects that Reedy was thinking of Field's French Crisis </s>
<s> But Twain first claimed his bantling from the fog of anonymity in 1906, in a letter addressed to Mr Charles Orr, librarian of Case Library, Cleveland </s>
<s> Said Clemens, in the course of his letter, dated July 30, 1906, from Dublin, New Hampshire: "The title of the piece is 1601 </s>
<s> The piece is a supposititious conversation which takes place in Queen Elizabeth's closet in that year, between the Queen, Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Duchess of Bilgewater, and one or two others, and is not, as John Hay mistakenly supposes, a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste Elizabeth's time; if there is a decent word findable in it, it is because I overlooked it </s>
<s> I hasten to assure you that it is not printed in my published writings" </s>
<s> TWITTING THE REV </s>
<s> JOSEPH TWICHELL The circumstances of how 1601 came to be written have since been officially revealed by Albert Bigelow Paine in 'Mark Twain, A Bibliography' (1912), and in the publication of Mark Twain's Notebook (1935) </s>
<s> 1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the Clemens family had retreated to Quarry Farm in Elmira County, New York </s>
<s> Here Mrs Clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations, the children romped over the countryside, and Mark retired to his octagonal study, which, perched high on the hill, looked out upon the valley below </s>
<s> It was in the famous summer of 1876, too, that Mark was putting the finishing touches to Tom Sawyer </s>
<s> Before the close of the same year he had already begun work on 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', published in 1885 </s>
<s> It is interesting to note the use of the title, the "Duke of Bilgewater," in Huck Finn when the "Duchess of Bilgewater" had already made her appearance in 1601 </s>
<s> Sandwiched between his two great masterpieces, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, the writing of 1601 was indeed a strange interlude </s>
<s> During this prolific period Mark wrote many minor items, most of them rejected by Howells, and read extensively in one of his favorite books, Pepys' Diary </s>
<s> Like many another writer Mark was captivated by Pepys' style and spirit, and "he determined," says Albert Bigelow Paine in his 'Mark Twain, A Biography', "to try his hand on an imaginary record of conversation and court manners of a bygone day, written in the phrase of the period </s>
<s> The result was 'Fireside Conversation in the Time of Queen Elizabeth', or as he later called it, '1601' </s>
<s> The 'conversation' recorded by a supposed Pepys of that period, was written with all the outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day, when fireside sociabilities were limited only to the loosened fancy, vocabulary, and physical performance, and not by any bounds of convention" </s>
<s> "It was written as a letter," continues Paine, "to that robust divine, Rev </s>
<s> Joseph Twichell, who, unlike Howells, had no scruples about Mark's 'Elizabethan breadth of parlance'." The Rev </s>
<s> Joseph Twichell, Mark's most intimate friend for over forty years, was pastor of the Asylum Hill Congregational Church of Hartford, which Mark facetiously called the "Church of the Holy Speculators," because of its wealthy parishioners </s>
<s> Here Mark had first met "Joe" at a social, and their meeting ripened into a glorious, life long friendship </s>
<s> Twichell was a man of about Mark's own age, a profound scholar, a devout Christian, "yet a man with an exuberant sense of humor, and a profound understanding of the frailties of mankind" </s>
<s> The Rev </s>
<s> Mr Twichell performed the marriage ceremony for Mark Twain and solemnized the births of his children; "Joe," his friend, counseled him on literary as well as personal matters for the remainder of Mark's life </s>
<s> It is important to catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was written, for without it one can not fully understand the spirit in which 1601 was written, or the keen enjoyment which Mark and "Joe" derived from it </s>
<s> "SAVE ME ONE" </s>
<s> The story of the first issue of 1601 is one of finesse, state diplomacy, and surreptitious printing </s>
<s> The Rev </s>
<s> "Joe" Twichell, for whose delectation the piece had been written, apparently had pocketed the document for four long years </s>
<s> Then, in 1880, it came into the hands of John Hay, later Secretary of State, presumably sent to him by Mark Twain </s>
<s> Hay pronounced the sketch a masterpiece, and wrote immediately to his old Cleveland friend, Alexander Gunn, prince of connoisseurs in art and literature </s>
<s> The following correspondence reveals the fine diplomacy which made the name of John Hay known throughout the world </s>
<s> DEPARTMENT OF STATE Washington, June 21, 1880 </s>
<s> Dear Gunn: Are you in Cleveland for all this week </s>
<s> If you will say yes by return mail, I have a masterpiece to submit to your consideration which is only in my hands for a few days </s>
<s> Yours, very much worritted by the depravity of Christendom, Hay The second letter discloses Hay's own high opinion of the effort and his deep concern for its safety </s>
<s> June 24, 1880 My dear Gunn: Here it is </s>
<s> It was written by Mark Twain in a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste Elizabethan standard </s>
<s> But the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything so classic </s>
<s> He has not yet been able even to find a publisher </s>
<s> The Globe has not yet recovered from Downey's inroad, and they won't touch it </s>
<s> I send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of appreciative critics, who know a good thing when they see it </s>
<s> Read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me; for Mark is impatient to see once more his wandering offspring </s>
<s> Yours, Hay </s>
<s> In his third letter one can almost hear Hay's chuckle in the certainty that his diplomatic, if somewhat wicked, suggestion would bear fruit </s>
<s> Washington, D </s>
<s> C.July 7, 1880 My dear Gunn: I have your letter, and the proposition which you make to pull a few proofs of the masterpiece is highly attractive, and of course highly immoral </s>
<s> I cannot properly consent to it, and I am afraid the great many would think I was taking an unfair advantage of his confidence </s>
<s> Please send back the document as soon as you can, and if, in spite of my prohibition, you take these proofs, save me one </s>
<s> Very truly yours, John Hay </s>
<s> Thus was this Elizabethan dialogue poured into the moulds of cold type </s>
<s> According to Merle Johnson, Mark Twain's bibliographer, it was issued in pamphlet form, without wrappers or covers; there were 8 pages of text and the pamphlet measured 7 by 8 1/2 inches </s>
<s> Only four copies are believed to have been printed, one for Hay, one for Gunn, and two for Twain </s>
<s> "In the matter of humor," wrote Clemens, referring to Hay's delicious notes, "what an unsurpassable touch John Hay had" </s>
<s> HUMOR AT WEST POINT The first printing of 1601 in actual book form was "Donne at ye Academie Press," in 1882, West Point, New York, under the supervision of Lieut </s>
<s> C </s>
<s> E </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Wood, then adjutant of the U </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Military Academy </s>
<s> In 1882 Mark Twain and Joe Twichell visited their friend Lieut </s>
<s> Wood at West Point, where they learned that Wood, as Adjutant, had under his control a small printing establishment </s>
<s> On Mark's return to Hartford, Wood received a letter asking if he would do Mark a great favor by printing something he had written, which he did not care to entrust to the ordinary printer </s>
<s> Wood replied that he would be glad to oblige </s>
<s> On April 3, 1882, Mark sent the manuscript: "I enclose the original of 1603 [sic] as you suggest </s>
<s> I am afraid there are errors in it, also, heedlessness in antiquated spelling--e's stuck on often at end of words where they are not strictly necessary, etc... </s>
<s> I would go through the manuscript but I am too much driven just now, and it is not important anyway </s>
<s> I wish you would do me the kindness to make any and all corrections that suggest themselves to you </s>
<s> "Sincerely yours, "S </s>
<s> L </s>
<s> Clemens" </s>
<s> Charles Erskine Scott Wood recalled in a foreword, which he wrote for the limited edition of 1601 issued by the Grabhorn Press, how he felt when he first saw the original manuscript </s>
<s> "When I read it," writes Wood, "I felt that the character of it would be carried a little better by a printing which pretended to the eye that it was contemporaneous with the pretended 'conversation' </s>
<s> "I wrote Mark that for literary effect I thought there should be a species of forgery, though of course there was no effort to actually deceive a scholar </s>
<s> Mark answered that I might do as I liked;--that his only object was to secure a number of copies, as the demand for it was becoming burdensome, but he would be very grateful for any interest I brought to the doing </s>
<s> "Well, Tucker [foreman of the printing shop] and I soaked some handmade linen paper in weak coffee, put it as a wet bundle into a warm room to mildew, dried it to a dampness approved by Tucker and he printed the 'copy' on a hand press </s>
<s> I had special punches cut for such Elizabethan abbreviations as the a, e, o and u, when followed by m or n--and for the (commonly and stupidly pronounced ye) </s>
<s> "The only editing I did was as to the spelling and a few old English words introduced </s>
<s> The spelling, if I remember correctly, is mine, but the text is exactly as written by Mark </s>
<s> I wrote asking his view of making the spelling of the period and he was enthusiastic--telling me to do whatever I thought best and he was greatly pleased with the result" </s>
<s> Thus was printed in a de luxe edition of fifty copies the most curious masterpiece of American humor, at one of America's most dignified institutions, the United States Military Academy at West Point </s>
<s> "1601 was so be-praised by the archaeological scholars of a quarter of a century ago," wrote Clemens in his letter to Charles Orr, "that I was rather inordinately vain of it </s>
<s> At that time it had been privately printed in several countries, among them Japan </s>
<s> A sumptuous edition on large paper, rough-edged, was made by Lieut </s>
<s> C </s>
<s> E </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Wood at West Point --an edition of 50 copies--and distributed among popes and kings and such people </s>
<s> In England copies of that issue were worth twenty guineas when I was there six years ago, and none to be had" </s>
<s> FROM THE DEPTHS Mark Twain's irreverence should not be misinterpreted: it was an irreverence which bubbled up from a deep, passionate insight into the well-springs of human nature </s>
<s> In 1601, as in 'The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,' and in 'The Mysterious Stranger,' he tore the masks off human beings and left them cringing before the public view </s>
<s> With the deftness of a master surgeon Clemens dealt with human emotions and delighted in exposing human nature in the raw </s>
<s> The spirit and the language of the Fireside Conversation were rooted deep in Mark Twain's nature and in his life, as C </s>
<s> E </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Wood, who printed 1601 at West Point, has pertinently observed, "If I made a guess as to the intellectual ferment out of which 1601 rose I would say that Mark's intellectual structure and subconscious graining was from Anglo-Saxons as primitive as the common man of the Tudor period </s>
<s> He came from the banks of the Mississippi--from the flatboatmen, pilots, roustabouts, farmers and village folk of a rude, primitive people--as Lincoln did </s>
<s> "He was finished in the mining camps of the West among stage drivers, gamblers and the men of '49 </s>
<s> The simple roughness of a frontier people was in his blood and brain </s>
<s> "Words vulgar and offensive to other ears were a common language to him </s>
<s> Anyone who ever knew Mark heard him use them freely, forcibly, picturesquely in his unrestrained conversation </s>
<s> Such language is forcible as all primitive words are </s>
<s> Refinement seems to make for weakness--or let us say a cutting edge--but the old vulgar monosyllabic words bit like the blow of a pioneer's ax--and Mark was like that </s>
<s> Then I think 1601 came out of Mark's instinctive humor, satire and hatred of puritanism </s>
<s> But there is more than this; with all its humor there is a sense of real delight in what may be called obscenity for its own sake </s>
<s> Whitman and the Bible are no more obscene than Nature herself--no more obscene than a manure pile, out of which come roses and cherries </s>
<s> Every word used in 1601 was used by our own rude pioneers as a part of their vocabulary--and no word was ever invented by man with obscene intent, but only as language to express his meaning </s>
<s> No act of nature is obscene in itself--but when such words and acts are dragged in for an ulterior purpose they become offensive, as everything out of place is offensive </s>
<s> I think he delighted, too, in shocking--giving resounding slaps on what Chaucer would quite simply call 'the bare erse'." Quite aside from this Chaucerian "erse" slapping, Clemens had also a semi-serious purpose, that of reproducing a past time as he saw it in Shakespeare, Dekker, Jonson, and other writers of the Elizabethan era </s>
<s> Fireside Conversation was an exercise in scholarship illumined by a keen sense of character </s>
<s> It was made especially effective by the artistic arrangement of widely-gathered material into a compressed picture of a phase of the manners and even the minds of the men and women "in the spacious times of great Elizabeth" </s>
<s> Mark Twain made of 1601 a very smart and fascinating performance, carried over almost to grotesqueness just to show it was not done for mere delight in the frank naturalism of the functions with which it deals </s>
<s> That Mark Twain had made considerable study of this frankness is apparent from chapter four of 'A Yankee At King Arthur's Court,' where he refers to the conversation at the famous Round Table thus: "Many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen of the land would have made a Comanche blush </s>
<s> Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea </s>
<s> However, I had read Tom Jones and Roderick Random and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or no cleaner in their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies, clear up to one hundred years ago; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century--in which century, broadly speaking, the earliest samples of the real lady and the real gentleman discoverable in English history,--or in European history, for that matter--may be said to have made their appearance </s>
<s> Suppose Sir Walter [Scott] instead of putting the conversation into the mouths of his characters, had allowed the characters to speak for themselves </s>
<s> We should have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena which would embarrass a tramp in our day </s>
<s> However, to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate" </s>
<s> Mark Twain's interest in history and in the depiction of historical periods and characters is revealed through his fondness for historical reading in preference to fiction, and through his other historical writings </s>
<s> Even in the hilarious, youthful days in San Francisco, Paine reports that "Clemens, however, was never quite ready for sleep </s>
<s> Then, as ever, he would prop himself up in bed, light his pipe, and lose himself in English or French history until his sleep conquered" </s>
<s> Paine tells us, too, that Lecky's 'European Morals' was an old favorite </s>
<s> The notes to 'The Prince and the Pauper' show again how carefully Clemens examined his historical background, and his interest in these materials </s>
<s> Some of the more important sources are noted: Hume's 'History of England', Timbs' 'Curiosities of London', J </s>
<s> Hammond Trumbull's 'Blue Laws, True and False' </s>
<s> Apparently Mark Twain relished it, for as Bernard DeVoto points out, "The book is always Mark Twain </s>
<s> Its parodies of Tudor speech lapse sometimes into a callow satisfaction in that idiom--Mark hugely enjoys his nathlesses and beshrews and marrys" </s>
<s> The writing of 1601 foreshadows his fondness for this treatment </s>
<s> "Do you suppose the liberties and the Brawn of These States have to do only with delicate lady-words </s>
<s> with gloved gentleman words" Walt Whitman, 'An American Primer' </s>
<s> Although 1601 was not matched by any similar sketch in his published works, it was representative of Mark Twain the man </s>
<s> He was no emaciated literary tea-tosser </s>
<s> Bronzed and weatherbeaten son of the West, Mark was a man's man, and that significant fact is emphasized by the several phases of Mark's rich life as steamboat pilot, printer, miner, and frontier journalist </s>
<s> On the Virginia City Enterprise Mark learned from editor R </s>
<s> M </s>
<s> Daggett that "when it was necessary to call a man names, there were no expletives too long or too expressive to be hurled in rapid succession to emphasize the utter want of character of the man assailed... </s>
<s> There were typesetters there who could hurl anathemas at bad copy which would have frightened a Bengal tiger </s>
<s> The news editor could damn a mutilated dispatch in twenty-four languages" </s>
<s> In San Francisco in the sizzling sixties we catch a glimpse of Mark Twain and his buddy, Steve Gillis, pausing in doorways to sing "The Doleful Ballad of the Neglected Lover," an old piece of uncollected erotica </s>
<s> One morning, when a dog began to howl, Steve awoke "to find his room-mate standing in the door that opened out into a back garden, holding a big revolver, his hand shaking with cold and excitement," relates Paine in his Biography </s>
<s> "'Come here, Steve,' he said </s>
<s> 'I'm so chilled through I can't get a bead on him' </s>
<s> "'Sam,' said Steve, 'don't shoot him </s>
<s> Just swear at him </s>
<s> You can easily kill him at any range with your profanity' </s>
<s> "Steve Gillis declares that Mark Twain let go such a scorching, singeing blast that the brute's owner sold him the next day for a Mexican hairless dog" </s>
<s> Nor did Mark's "geysers of profanity" cease spouting after these gay and youthful days in San Francisco </s>
<s> With Clemens it may truly be said that profanity was an art--a pyrotechnic art that entertained nations </s>
<s> "It was my duty to keep buttons on his shirts," recalled Katy Leary, life-long housekeeper and friend in the Clemens menage, "and he'd swear something terrible if I didn't </s>
<s> If he found a shirt in his drawer without a button on, he'd take every single shirt out of that drawer and throw them right out of the window, rain or shine--out of the bathroom window they'd go </s>
<s> I used to look out every morning to see the snowflakes--anything white </s>
<s> Out they'd fly... </s>
<s> Oh </s>
<s> he'd swear at anything when he was on a rampage </s>
<s> He'd swear at his razor if it didn't cut right, and Mrs Clemens used to send me around to the bathroom door sometimes to knock and ask him what was the matter </s>
<s> Well, I'd go and knock; I'd say, 'Mrs Clemens wants to know what's the matter' </s>
<s> And then he'd say to me (kind of low) in a whisper like, 'Did she hear me Katy' </s>
<s> 'Yes,' I'd say, 'every word' </s>
<s> Oh, well, he was ashamed then, he was afraid of getting scolded for swearing like that, because Mrs Clemens hated swearing" </s>
<s> But his swearing never seemed really bad to Katy Leary, "It was sort of funny, and a part of him, somehow," she said </s>
<s> "Sort of amusing it was--and gay--not like real swearing, 'cause he swore like an angel" </s>
<s> In his later years at Stormfield Mark loved to play his favorite billiards </s>
<s> "It was sometimes a wonderful and fearsome thing to watch Mr Clemens play billiards," relates Elizabeth Wallace </s>
<s> "He loved the game, and he loved to win, but he occasionally made a very bad stroke, and then the varied, picturesque, and unorthodox vocabulary, acquired in his more youthful years, was the only thing that gave him comfort </s>
<s> Gently, slowly, with no profane inflexions of voice, but irresistibly as though they had the headwaters of the Mississippi for their source, came this stream of unholy adjectives and choice expletives" </s>
<s> Mark's vocabulary ran the whole gamut of life itself </s>
<s> In Paris, in his appearance in 1879 before the Stomach Club, a jolly lot of gay wags, Mark's address, reports Paine, "obtained a wide celebrity among the clubs of the world, though no line of it, not even its title, has ever found its way into published literature" </s>
<s> It is rumored to have been called "Some Remarks on the Science of Onanism" </s>
<s> In Berlin, Mark asked Henry W </s>
<s> Fisher to accompany him on an exploration of the Berlin Royal Library, where the librarian, having learned that Clemens had been the Kaiser's guest at dinner, opened the secret treasure chests for the famous visitor </s>
<s> One of these guarded treasures was a volume of grossly indecent verses by Voltaire, addressed to Frederick the Great </s>
<s> "Too much is enough," Mark is reported to have said, when Fisher translated some of the verses, "I would blush to remember any of these stanzas except to tell Krafft-Ebing about them when I get to Vienna" </s>
<s> When Fisher had finished copying a verse for him Mark put it into his pocket, saying, "Livy [Mark's wife, Olivia] is so busy mispronouncing German these days she can't even attempt to get at this" </s>
<s> In his letters, too, Howells observed, "He had the Southwestern, the Lincolnian, the Elizabethan breadth of parlance, which I suppose one ought not to call coarse without calling one's self prudish; and I was often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion; I could not bear to burn them, and I could not, after the first reading, quite bear to look at them </s>
<s> I shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that in it he was Shakespearean" </s>
<s> "With a nigger squat on her safety-valve" John Hay, Pike County Ballads </s>
<s> "Is there any other explanation," asks Van Wyck Brooks, "'of his Elizabethan breadth of parlance' </s>
<s> Mr Howells confesses that he sometimes blushed over Mark Twain's letters, that there were some which, to the very day when he wrote his eulogy on his dead friend, he could not bear to reread </s>
<s> Perhaps if he had not so insisted, in former years, while going over Mark Twain's proofs, upon 'having that swearing out in an instant,' he would never had had cause to suffer from his having 'loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion' </s>
<s> Mark Twain's verbal Rabelaisianism was obviously the expression of that vital sap which, not having been permitted to inform his work, had been driven inward and left there to ferment </s>
<s> No wonder he was always indulging in orgies of forbidden words </s>
<s> Consider the famous book, 1601, that fireside conversation in the time of Queen Elizabeth: is there any obsolete verbal indecency in the English language that Mark Twain has not painstakingly resurrected and assembled there </s>
<s> He, whose blood was in constant ferment and who could not contain within the narrow bonds that had been set for him the riotous exuberance of his nature, had to have an escape-valve, and he poured through it a fetid stream of meaningless obscenity--the waste of a priceless psychic material" </s>
<s> Thus, Brooks lumps 1601 with Mark Twain's "bawdry," and interprets it simply as another indication of frustration </s>
<s> FIGS FOR FIG LEAVES </s>
<s> Of course, the writing of such a piece as 1601 raised the question of freedom of expression for the creative artist </s>
<s> Although little discussed at that time, it was a question which intensely interested Mark, and for a fuller appreciation of Mark's position one must keep in mind the year in which 1601 was written, 1876 </s>
<s> There had been nothing like it before in American literature; there had appeared no Caldwells, no Faulkners, no Hemingways </s>
<s> Victorian England was gushing Tennyson </s>
<s> In the United States polite letters was a cult of the Brahmins of Boston, with William Dean Howells at the helm of the Atlantic </s>
<s> Louisa May Alcott published Little Women in 1868-69, and Little Men in 1871 </s>
<s> In 1873 Mark Twain led the van of the debunkers, scraping the gilt off the lily in the Gilded Age </s>
<s> In 1880 Mark took a few pot shots at license in Art and Literature in his Tramp Abroad, "I wonder why some things are </s>
<s> For instance, Art is allowed as much indecent license to-day as in earlier times--but the privileges of Literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past eighty or ninety years </s>
<s> Fielding and Smollet could portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language; we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day, but we are not allowed to approach them very near, even with nice and guarded forms of speech </s>
<s> But not so with Art </s>
<s> The brush may still deal freely with any subject; however revolting or indelicate </s>
<s> It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore, to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues </s>
<s> These works, which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages, are all fig-leaved now </s>
<s> Yes, every one of them </s>
<s> Nobody noticed their nakedness before, perhaps; nobody can help noticing it now, the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous </s>
<s> But the comical thing about it all, is, that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid marble, which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty, whereas warm-blooded paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it </s>
<s> "At the door of the Ufizzi, in Florence, one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman, noseless, battered, black with accumulated grime--they hardly suggest human beings--yet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig-leaved by this fastidious generation </s>
<s> You enter, and proceed to that most-visited little gallery that exists in the world... </s>
<s> and there, against the wall, without obstructing rag or leaf, you may look your fill upon the foulest, the vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses--Titian's Venus </s>
<s> It isn't that she is naked and stretched out on a bed--no, it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand </s>
<s> If I ventured to describe the attitude, there would be a fine howl--but there the Venus lies, for anybody to gloat over that wants to--and there she has a right to lie, for she is a work of art, and Art has its privileges </s>
<s> I saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her; I saw young men gaze long and absorbedly at her; I saw aged, infirm men hang upon her charms with a pathetic interest </s>
<s> How I should like to describe her--just to see what a holy indignation I could stir up in the world--just to hear the unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and coarseness, and all that </s>
<s> "In every gallery in Europe there are hideous pictures of blood, carnage, oozing brains, putrefaction--pictures portraying intolerable suffering--pictures alive with every conceivable horror, wrought out in dreadful detail--and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibited--without a growl from anybody--for they are innocent, they are inoffensive, being works of art </s>
<s> But suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things--the critics would skin him alive </s>
<s> Well, let it go, it cannot be helped; Art retains her privileges, Literature has lost hers </s>
<s> Somebody else may cipher out the whys and the wherefores and the consistencies of it--I haven't got time" </s>
<s> PROFESSOR SCENTS PORNOGRAPHY Unfortunately, 1601 has recently been tagged by Professor Edward Wagenknecht as "the most famous piece of pornography in American literature" </s>
<s> Like many another uninformed, Prof </s>
<s> W </s>
<s> is like the little boy who is shocked to see "naughty" words chalked on the back fence, and thinks they are pornography </s>
<s> The initiated, after years of wading through the mire, will recognize instantly the significant difference between filthy filth and funny "filth" </s>
<s> Dirt for dirt's sake is something else again </s>
<s> Pornography, an eminent American jurist has pointed out, is distinguished by the "leer of the sensualist" </s>
<s> "The words which are criticised as dirty," observed justice John M </s>

<s> He also tells of an instance in parliament, and of a rather brilliant bon mot spoken upon that occasion </s>
<s> "While Fowler was speaking Finch-Hatton had shewn signs of restlessness; towards the end of the speech he had moved some three yards away from the Baronet </s>
<s> As soon as Fowler sat down Finch-Hatton sprang up holding his handkerchief to his nose: "'Mr Speaker,' he began, and was at once acknowledged by the Speaker, for it was a maiden speech, and as such was entitled to precedence by the courteous custom of the House, 'I know why the Right Honourable Member from the City did not conclude his speech with a proposal </s>
<s> The only way to conclude such a speech appropriately would be with a motion'!" AEOLIAN CREPITATIONS But society had apparently degenerated sadly in modern times, and even in the era of Elizabeth, for at an earlier date it was a serious--nay, capital--offense to break wind in the presence of majesty </s>
<s> The Emperor Claudius, hearing that one who had suppressed the urge while paying him court had suffered greatly thereby, "intended to issue an edict, allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to any distension occasioned by flatulence:" Martial, too (Book XII, Epigram LXXVII), tells of the embarrassment of one who broke wind while praying in the Capitol, "One day, while standing upright, addressing his prayers to Jupiter, Aethon farted in the Capitol </s>

<s> Since that time, miserable Aethon, when he wishes to enter the Capitol, goes first to Paterclius' privies and farts ten or twenty times </s>
<s> Yet, in spite of this precautionary crepitation, he salutes Jove with constricted buttocks" </s>
<s> Martial also (Book IV, Epigram LXXX), ridicules a woman who was subject to the habit, saying, "Your Bassa, Fabullus, has always a child at her side, calling it her darling and her plaything; and yet--more wonder--she does not care for children </s>
<s> What is the reason then </s>
<s> Bassa is apt to fart </s>

The tale is told, too, of a certain woman who performed an aeolian crepitation at a dinner attended by the witty Monsignieur Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans, and that when, to cover up her lapse, she began to scrape her feet upon the floor, and to make similar noises, the Bishop said, "Do not trouble to find a rhyme, Madam" </s>
<s> Nay, worthier names than those of any yet mentioned have discussed the matter </s>

<s> Benjamin Franklin, in his "Letter to the Royal Academy of Brussels" has canvassed suggested remedies for alleviating the stench attendant upon these discharges: "My Prize Question therefore should be: To discover some Drug, wholesome and--not disagreeable, to be mixed with our common food, or sauces, that shall render the natural discharges of Wind from our Bodies not only inoffensive, but agreeable as Perfumes </s>

<s> He that dines on stale Flesh, especially with much Addition of Onions, shall be able to afford a stink that no Company can tolerate; while he that has lived for some time on Vegetables only, shall have that Breath so pure as to be insensible of the most delicate Noses; and if he can manage so as to avoid the Report, he may anywhere give vent to his Griefs, unnoticed </s>
<s> But as there are many to whom an entire Vegetable Diet would be inconvenient, & as a little quick Lime thrown into a Jakes will correct the amazing Quantity of fetid Air arising from the vast Mass of putrid Matter contained in such Places, and render it pleasing to the Smell, who knows but that a little Powder of Lime (or some other equivalent) taken in our Food, or perhaps a Glass of Lime Water drank at Dinner, may have the same Effect on the Air produced in and issuing from our Bowels" </s>
<s> One curious commentary on the text is that Elizabeth should be so fond of investigating into the authorship of the exhalation in question, when she was inordinately fond of strong and sweet perfumes; in fact, she was responsible for the tremendous increase in importations of scents into England during her reign </s>
<s> "YE BOKE OF YE SIEUR MICHAEL DE MONTAINE" There is a curious admixture of error and misunderstanding in this part of the sketch </s>
<s> In the first place, the story is borrowed from Montaigne, where it is told inaccurately, and then further corrupted in the telling </s>
<s> It was not the good widows of Perigord who wore the phallus upon their coifs; it was the young married women, of the district near Montaigne's home, who paraded it to view upon their foreheads, as a symbol, says our essayist, "of the joy they derived therefrom" </s>
<s> If they became widows, they reversed its position, and covered it up with the rest of their head-dress </s>
<s> The "emperor" mentioned was not an emperor; he was Procolus, a native of Albengue, on the Genoese coast, who, with Bonosus, led the unsuccessful rebellion in Gaul against Emperor Probus </s>
<s> Even so keen a commentator as Cotton has failed to note the error </s>
<s> The empress (Montaigne does not say "his empress") was Messalina, third wife of the Emperor Claudius, who was uncle of Caligula and foster-father to Nero </s>
<s> Furthermore, in her case the charge is that she copulated with twenty-five in a single night, and not twenty-two, as appears in the text </s>
<s> Montaigne is right in his statistics, if original sources are correct, whereas the author erred in transcribing the incident </s>
<s> As for Proculus, it has been noted that he was associated with Bonosus, who was as renowned in the field of Bacchus as was Proculus in that of Venus (Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) </s>
<s> The feat of Proculus is told in his own words, in Vopiscus, (Hist </s>
<s> Augustine, p </s>
<s> 246) where he recounts having captured one hundred Sarmatian virgins, and unmaidened ten of them in one night, together with the happenings subsequent thereto </s>
<s> Concerning Messalina, there appears to be no question but that she was a nymphomaniac, and that, while Empress of Rome, she participated in some fearful debaucheries </s>
<s> The question is what to believe, for much that we have heard about her is almost certainly apocryphal </s>
<s> The author from whom Montaigne took his facts is the elder Pliny, who, in his Natural History, Book X, Chapter 83, says, "Other animals become sated with veneral pleasures; man hardly knows any satiety </s>
<s> Messalina, the wife of Claudius Caesar, thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress, selected for the purpose of deciding the question, one of the most notorious women who followed the profession of a hired prostitute; and the empress outdid her, after continuous intercourse, night and day, at the twenty-fifth embrace" </s>
<s> But Pliny, notwithstanding his great attainments, was often a retailer of stale gossip, and in like case was Aurelius Victor, another writer who heaped much odium on her name </s>
<s> Again, there is a great hiatus in the Annals of Tacitus, a true historian, at the period covering the earlier days of the Empress; while Suetonius, bitter as he may be, is little more than an anecdotist </s>
<s> Juvenal, another of her detractors, is a prejudiced witness, for he started out to satirize female vice, and naturally aimed at high places </s>
<s> Dio also tells of Messalina's misdeeds, but his work is under the same limitations as that of Suetonius </s>
<s> Furthermore, none but Pliny mentions the excess under consideration </s>
<s> However, "where there is much smoke there must be a little fire," and based upon the superimposed testimony of the writers of the period, there appears little doubt but that Messalina was a nymphomaniac, that she prostituted herself in the public stews, naked, and with gilded nipples, and that she did actually marry her chief adulterer, Silius, while Claudius was absent at Ostia, and that the wedding was consummated in the presence of a concourse of witnesses </s>
<s> This was "the straw that broke the camel's back" </s>
<s> Claudius hastened back to Rome, Silius was dispatched, and Messalina, lacking the will-power to destroy herself, was killed when an officer ran a sword through her abdomen, just as it appeared that Claudius was about to relent </s>
<s> "THEN SPAKE YE DAMNED WINDMILL, SIR WALTER" Raleigh is thoroughly in character here; this observation is quite in keeping with the general veracity of his account of his travels in Guiana, one of the most mendacious accounts of adventure ever told </s>
<s> Naturally, the scholarly researches of Westermarck have failed to discover this people; perhaps Lady Helen might best be protected among the Jibaros of Ecuador, where the men marry when approaching forty </s>
<s> Ben Jonson in his Conversations observed "That Sr </s>
<s> W </s>
<s> Raughlye esteemed more of fame than of conscience" </s>
<s> YE VIRGIN QUEENE Grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of Elizabeth to the title, "The Virgin Queen," and it is utterly impossible to dispose of the issue in a note </s>
<s> However, the weight of opinion appears to be in the negative </s>
<s> Many and great were the difficulties attending the marriage of a Protestant princess in those troublous times, and Elizabeth finally announced that she would become wedded to the English nation, and she wore a ring in token thereof until her death </s>
<s> However, more or less open liaisons with Essex and Leicester, as well as a host of lesser courtiers, her ardent temperament, and her imperious temper, are indications that cannot be denied in determining any estimate upon the point in question </s>
<s> Ben Jonson in his Conversations with William Drummond of Hawthornden says, "Queen Elizabeth never saw herself after she became old in a true glass; they painted her, and sometymes would vermillion her nose </s>
<s> She had allwayes about Christmass evens set dice that threw sixes or five, and she knew not they were other, to make her win and esteame herself fortunate </s>

<s> When the attempt became known, Elizabeth repudiated the acts of her agents, but Sir Nicholas, having anticipated this possibility, had sufficient foresight to secure endorsement of his plan by the Council, and so outwitted Elizabeth, who was playing a two-faced role, and Cecil, one of the greatest statesmen who ever held the post of principal minister </s>
