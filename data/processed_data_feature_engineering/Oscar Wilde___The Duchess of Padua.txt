<s> GUIDO Why, yes </s>
<s> It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard, just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter, signed 'Your Father's Friend,' bidding me be here to-day if I would know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the writer </s>

<s> I don't believe in him, Guido </s>
<s> I think it is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me to the nearest tavern </s>

<s> GUIDO Well, I suppose you are right </s>
<s> Ah </s>

<s> [Sits down on a stone seat.] Stood he tall </s>
<s> I warrant he looked tall upon his horse </s>
<s> His hair was black </s>
<s> or perhaps a reddish gold, Like a red fire of gold </s>
<s> Was his voice low </s>
<s> The very bravest men have voices sometimes Full of low music; or a clarion was it That brake with terror all his enemies </s>
<s> Did he ride singly </s>
<s> or with many squires And valiant gentlemen to serve his state </s>
<s> For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins Beat with the blood of kings </s>
<s> Was he a king </s>
<s> MORANZONE Ay, of all men he was the kingliest </s>
<s> GUIDO [proudly] Then when you saw my noble father last He was set high above the heads of men </s>
<s> MORANZONE Ay, he was high above the heads of men, [Walks over to GUIDO and puts his hand upon his shoulder.] On a red scaffold, with a butcher's block Set for his neck </s>
<s> GUIDO [leaping up] What dreadful man art thou, That like a raven, or the midnight owl, Com'st with this awful message from the grave </s>
<s> MORANZONE I am known here as the Count Moranzone, Lord of a barren castle on a rock, With a few acres of unkindly land And six not thrifty servants </s>
<s> But I was one Of Parma's noblest princes; more than that, I was your father's friend </s>
<s> GUIDO [clasping his hand] Tell me of him </s>
<s> MORANZONE You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo, He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke Of all the fair domains of Lombardy Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even Was wont to pay him tribute - GUIDO Come to his death </s>
<s> MORANZONE You will hear that soon enough </s>
<s> Being at war - O noble lion of war, that would not suffer Injustice done in Italy!--he led The very flower of chivalry against That foul adulterous Lord of Rimini, Giovanni Malatesta--whom God curse </s>

<s> GUIDO [clutching his dagger] Doth Malatesta live </s>

<s> GUIDO Did you say dead </s>

<s> MORANZONE Judas said you, boy </s>
<s> Yes, Judas in his treachery, but still He was more wise than Judas was, and held Those thirty silver pieces not enough </s>
<s> GUIDO What got he for my father's blood </s>
<s> MORANZONE What got he </s>
<s> Why cities, fiefs, and principalities, Vineyards, and lands </s>
<s> GUIDO Of which he shall but keep Six feet of ground to rot in </s>
<s> Where is he, This damned villain, this foul devil </s>
<s> where </s>
<s> Show me the man, and come he cased in steel, In complete panoply and pride of war, Ay, guarded by a thousand men-at-arms, Yet I shall reach him through their spears, and feel The last black drop of blood from his black heart Crawl down my blade </s>
<s> Show me the man, I say, And I will kill him </s>
<s> MORANZONE [coldly] Fool, what revenge is there </s>
<s> Death is the common heritage of all, And death comes best when it comes suddenly </s>
<s> [Goes up close to GUIDO.] Your father was betrayed, there is your cue; For you shall sell the seller in his turn </s>
<s> I will make you of his household, you shall sit At the same board with him, eat of his bread - GUIDO O bitter bread </s>
<s> MORANZONE Thy palate is too nice, Revenge will make it sweet </s>
<s> Thou shalt o' nights Pledge him in wine, drink from his cup, and be His intimate, so he will fawn on thee, Love thee, and trust thee in all secret things </s>
<s> If he bid thee be merry thou must laugh, And if it be his humour to be sad Thou shalt don sables </s>
<s> Then when the time is ripe - [GUIDO clutches his sword.] Nay, nay, I trust thee not; your hot young blood, Undisciplined nature, and too violent rage Will never tarry for this great revenge, But wreck itself on passion </s>
<s> GUIDO Thou knowest me not </s>
<s> Tell me the man, and I in everything Will do thy bidding </s>
<s> MORANZONE Well, when the time is ripe, The victim trusting and the occasion sure, I will by sudden secret messenger Send thee a sign </s>
<s> GUIDO How shall I kill him, tell me </s>
<s> MORANZONE That night thou shalt creep into his private chamber; But if he sleep see that thou wake him first, And hold thy hand upon his throat, ay </s>
<s> that way, Then having told him of what blood thou art, Sprung from what father, and for what revenge, Bid him to pray for mercy; when he prays, Bid him to set a price upon his life, And when he strips himself of all his gold Tell him thou needest not gold, and hast not mercy, And do thy business straight away </s>
<s> Swear to me Thou wilt not kill him till I bid thee do it, Or else I go to mine own house, and leave Thee ignorant, and thy father unavenged </s>

<s> GUIDO Then by my father's grave - MORANZONE What grave </s>
<s> what grave </s>
<s> Your noble father lieth in no grave, I saw his dust strewn on the air, his ashes Whirled through the windy streets like common straws To plague a beggar's eyesight, and his head, That gentle head, set on the prison spike, For the vile rabble in their insolence To shoot their tongues at </s>
<s> GUIDO Was it so indeed </s>
<s> Then by my father's spotless memory, And by the shameful manner of his death, And by the base betrayal by his friend, For these at least remain, by these I swear I will not lay my hand upon his life Until you bid me, then--God help his soul, For he shall die as never dog died yet </s>
<s> And now, the sign, what is it </s>
<s> MORANZONE This dagger, boy; It was your father's </s>
<s> GUIDO Oh, let me look at it </s>
<s> I do remember now my reputed uncle, That good old husbandman I left at home, Told me a cloak wrapped round me when a babe Bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold; I like them best in steel, as they are here, They suit my purpose better </s>
<s> Tell me, sir, Have you no message from my father to me </s>
<s> MORANZONE Poor boy, you never saw that noble father, For when by his false friend he had been sold, Alone of all his gentlemen I escaped To bear the news to Parma to the Duchess </s>
<s> GUIDO Speak to me of my mother </s>
<s> MORANZONE When thy mother Heard my black news, she fell into a swoon, And, being with untimely travail seized - Bare thee into the world before thy time, And then her soul went heavenward, to wait Thy father, at the gates of Paradise </s>
<s> GUIDO A mother dead, a father sold and bartered </s>
<s> I seem to stand on some beleaguered wall, And messenger comes after messenger With a new tale of terror; give me breath, Mine ears are tired </s>

<s> DUKE Why, every man among them has his price, Although, to do them justice, some of them Are quite expensive </s>
<s> COUNT BARDI [aside] There it comes indeed </s>
<s> DUKE So be not honest; eccentricity Is not a thing should ever be encouraged, Although, in this dull stupid age of ours, The most eccentric thing a man can do Is to have brains, then the mob mocks at him; And for the mob, despise it as I do, I hold its bubble praise and windy favours In such account, that popularity Is the one insult I have never suffered </s>

<s> SECOND CITIZEN Marry, it means leaving things as they are; I like it not </s>
<s> DUKE Reform Lord Cardinal, did YOU say reform </s>

<s> DUCHESS My Lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch, The right to pity, and the right to mercy </s>
<s> DUKE So, so, you argue with me </s>
<s> This is she, The gentle Duchess for whose hand I yielded Three of the fairest towns in Italy, Pisa, and Genoa, and Orvieto </s>
<s> DUCHESS Promised, my Lord, not yielded: in that matter Brake you your word as ever </s>
<s> DUKE You wrong us, Madam, There were state reasons </s>
<s> DUCHESS What state reasons are there For breaking holy promises to a state </s>
<s> DUKE There are wild boars at Pisa in a forest Close to the city: when I promised Pisa Unto your noble and most trusting father, I had forgotten there was hunting there </s>

<s> Guido, your arm </s>
<s> Come, gentlemen, let us go And spur our falcons for the mid-day chase </s>
<s> Bethink you, Madam, you are here alone </s>
<s> [Exit the DUKE leaning on GUIDO, with his Court.] DUCHESS [looking after them] The Duke said rightly that I was alone; Deserted, and dishonoured, and defamed, Stood ever woman so alone indeed </s>

<s> 'Twere a good lesson If I did love you, sir; but, if I do not, What shall I say then </s>

<s> Nay, sweet, lift up your head, Let me unlock those little scarlet doors That shut in music, let me dive for coral In your red lips, and I'll bear back a prize Richer than all the gold the Gryphon guards In rude Armenia </s>

<s> [Kisses him.] GUIDO Methinks I am bold to look upon you thus: The gentle violet hides beneath its leaf And is afraid to look at the great sun For fear of too much splendour, but my eyes, O daring eyes </s>

<s> There are men who paint pictures, and carve statues, Paul of Verona and the dyer's son, Or their great rival, who, by the sea at Venice, Has set God's little maid upon the stair, White as her own white lily, and as tall, Or Raphael, whose Madonnas are divine Because they are mothers merely; yet I think Women are the best artists of the world, For they can take the common lives of men Soiled with the money-getting of our age, And with love make them beautiful </s>

<s> GUIDO I am resolved not to keep that oath </s>
<s> MORANZONE What of thy murdered father </s>
<s> GUIDO Dost thou think My father would be glad to see me coming, This old man's blood still hot upon mine hands </s>
<s> MORANZONE Ay </s>

<s> I will not kill this man </s>
<s> MORANZONE Why are you here, If not to kill him, then </s>
<s> GUIDO Lord Moranzone, I purpose to ascend to the Duke's chamber, And as he lies asleep lay on his breast The dagger and this writing; when he awakes Then he will know who held him in his power And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance Which I can take </s>
<s> MORANZONE You will not slay him </s>
<s> GUIDO No </s>
<s> MORANZONE Ignoble son of a noble father, Who sufferest this man who sold that father To live an hour </s>
<s> GUIDO 'Twas thou that hindered me; I would have killed him in the open square, The day I saw him first </s>

<s> MORANZONE You are a coward, Take out the knife, get to the Duke's chamber, And bring me back his heart upon the blade </s>
<s> When he is dead, then you can talk to me Of noble vengeances </s>
<s> GUIDO Upon thine honour, And by the love thou bearest my father's name, Dost thou think my father, that great gentleman, That generous soldier, that most chivalrous lord, Would have crept at night-time, like a common thief, And stabbed an old man sleeping in his bed, However he had wronged him: tell me that </s>
<s> MORANZONE [after some hesitation] You have sworn an oath, see that you keep that oath </s>
<s> Boy, do you think I do not know your secret, Your traffic with the Duchess </s>
<s> GUIDO Silence, liar </s>
<s> The very moon in heaven is not more chaste </s>
<s> Nor the white stars so pure </s>
<s> MORANZONE And yet, you love her; Weak fool, to let love in upon your life, Save as a plaything </s>
<s> GUIDO You do well to talk: Within your veins, old man, the pulse of youth Throbs with no ardour </s>
<s> Your eyes full of rheum Have against Beauty closed their filmy doors, And your clogged ears, losing their natural sense, Have shut you from the music of the world </s>
<s> You talk of love </s>
<s> You know not what it is </s>
<s> MORANZONE Oh, in my time, boy, have I walked i' the moon, Swore I would live on kisses and on blisses, Swore I would die for love, and did not die, Wrote love bad verses; ay, and sung them badly, Like all true lovers: Oh, I have done the tricks </s>
<s> I know the partings and the chamberings; We are all animals at best, and love Is merely passion with a holy name </s>
<s> GUIDO Now then I know you have not loved at all </s>
<s> Love is the sacrament of life; it sets Virtue where virtue was not; cleanses men Of all the vile pollutions of this world; It is the fire which purges gold from dross, It is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff, It is the spring which in some wintry soil Makes innocence to blossom like a rose </s>
<s> The days are over when God walked with men, But Love, which is his image, holds his place </s>
<s> When a man loves a woman, then he knows God's secret, and the secret of the world </s>
<s> There is no house so lowly or so mean, Which, if their hearts be pure who live in it, Love will not enter; but if bloody murder Knock at the Palace gate and is let in, Love like a wounded thing creeps out and dies </s>
<s> This is the punishment God sets on sin </s>
<s> The wicked cannot love </s>
<s> [A groan comes from the DUKE's chamber.] Ah </s>
<s> What is that </s>
<s> Do you not hear </s>
<s> 'Twas nothing </s>
<s> So I think That it is woman's mission by their love To save the souls of men: and loving her, My Lady, my white Beatrice, I begin To see a nobler and a holier vengeance In letting this man live, than doth reside In bloody deeds o' night, stabs in the dark, And young hands clutching at a palsied throat </s>
<s> It was, I think, for love's sake that Lord Christ, Who was indeed himself incarnate Love, Bade every man forgive his enemy </s>
<s> MORANZONE [sneeringly] That was in Palestine, not Padua; And said for saints: I have to do with men </s>
<s> GUIDO It was for all time said </s>
<s> MORANZONE And your white Duchess, What will she do to thank you </s>
<s> GUIDO Alas, I will not see her face again </s>
<s> 'Tis but twelve hours since I parted from her, So suddenly, and with such violent passion, That she has shut her heart against me now: No, I will never see her </s>
<s> MORANZONE What will you do </s>
<s> GUIDO After that I have laid the dagger there, Get hence to-night from Padua </s>
<s> MORANZONE And then </s>
<s> GUIDO I will take service with the Doge at Venice, And bid him pack me straightway to the wars, And there I will, being now sick of life, Throw that poor life against some desperate spear </s>
<s> [A groan from the DUKE'S chamber again.] Did you not hear a voice </s>
<s> MORANZONE I always hear, From the dim confines of some sepulchre, A voice that cries for vengeance </s>
<s> We waste time, It will be morning soon; are you resolved You will not kill the Duke </s>
<s> GUIDO I am resolved </s>
<s> MORANZONE O wretched father, lying unavenged </s>
<s> GUIDO More wretched, were thy son a murderer </s>
<s> MORANZONE Why, what is life </s>
<s> GUIDO I do not know, my lord, I did not give it, and I dare not take it </s>
<s> MORANZONE I do not thank God often; but I think I thank him now that I have got no son </s>
<s> And you, what bastard blood flows in your veins That when you have your enemy in your grasp You let him go </s>
<s> I would that I had left you With the dull hinds that reared you </s>

<s> LORD JUSTICE Ay, willingly, my lord, and may you turn him To make a full avowal of his guilt </s>
<s> [LORD MORANZONE goes over to GUIDO, who stands R </s>

<s> Nay, I saw it in her eyes </s>
<s> Boy, dost thou think I'll let thy father's son Be by this woman butchered to his death </s>
<s> Her husband sold your father, and the wife Would sell the son in turn </s>

<s> LORD JUSTICE Your Grace, it cannot be: The laws of Padua are most certain here: And by those laws the common murderer even May with his own lips plead, and make defence </s>
<s> DUCHESS This is no common murderer, Lord Justice, But a great outlaw, and a most vile traitor, Taken in open arms against the state </s>
<s> For he who slays the man who rules a state Slays the state also, widows every wife, And makes each child an orphan, and no less Is to be held a public enemy, Than if he came with mighty ordonnance, And all the spears of Venice at his back, To beat and batter at our city gates - Nay, is more dangerous to our commonwealth, For walls and gates, bastions and forts, and things Whose common elements are wood and stone May be raised up, but who can raise again The ruined body of my murdered lord, And bid it live and laugh </s>

<s> GUIDO Unhand me, knaves </s>

<s> You dare not burden my o'erburdened soul With two dead men </s>
<s> I think one is enough </s>
<s> For when I stand before God, face to face, I would not have you, with a scarlet thread Around your white throat, coming up behind To say I did it </s>
<s> GUIDO Madam, I wait </s>
<s> DUCHESS No, no, you cannot: you do not understand, I have less power in Padua to-night Than any common woman; they will kill you </s>
<s> I saw the scaffold as I crossed the square, Already the low rabble throng about it With fearful jests, and horrid merriment, As though it were a morris-dancer's platform, And not Death's sable throne </s>
<s> O Guido, Guido, You must escape </s>
<s> GUIDO Madam, I tarry here </s>
<s> DUCHESS Guido, you shall not: it would be a thing So terrible that the amazed stars Would fall from heaven, and the palsied moon Be in her sphere eclipsed, and the great sun Refuse to shine upon the unjust earth Which saw thee die </s>
<s> GUIDO Be sure I shall not stir </s>
<s> DUCHESS [wringing her hands] Is one sin not enough, but must it breed A second sin more horrible again Than was the one that bare it </s>
<s> O God, God, Seal up sin's teeming womb, and make it barren, I will not have more blood upon my hand Than I have now </s>
<s> GUIDO [seizing her hand] What </s>
<s> am I fallen so low That I may not have leave to die for you </s>
<s> DUCHESS [tearing her hand away] Die for me?--no, my life is a vile thing, Thrown to the miry highways of this world; You shall not die for me, you shall not, Guido; I am a guilty woman </s>
<s> GUIDO Guilty?--let those Who know what a thing temptation is, Let those who have not walked as we have done, In the red fire of passion, those whose lives Are dull and colourless, in a word let those, If any such there be, who have not loved, Cast stones against you </s>
<s> As for me - DUCHESS Alas </s>
<s> GUIDO [falling at her feet] You are my lady, and you are my love </s>
<s> O hair of gold, O crimson lips, O face Made for the luring and the love of man </s>
<s> Incarnate image of pure loveliness </s>
<s> Worshipping thee I do forget the past, Worshipping thee my soul comes close to thine, Worshipping thee I seem to be a god, And though they give my body to the block, Yet is my love eternal </s>
<s> [DUCHESS puts her hands over her face: GUIDO draws them down.] Sweet, lift up The trailing curtains that overhang your eyes That I may look into those eyes, and tell you I love you, never more than now when Death Thrusts his cold lips between us: Beatrice, I love you: have you no word left to say </s>
<s> Oh, I can bear the executioner, But not this silence: will you not say you love me </s>
<s> Speak but that word and Death shall lose his sting, But speak it not, and fifty thousand deaths Are, in comparison, mercy </s>
<s> Oh, you are cruel, And do not love me </s>
<s> DUCHESS Alas </s>
<s> I have no right For I have stained the innocent hands of love With spilt-out blood: there is blood on the ground; I set it there </s>
<s> GUIDO Sweet, it was not yourself, It was some devil tempted you </s>
<s> DUCHESS [rising suddenly] No, no, We are each our own devil, and we make This world our hell </s>
<s> GUIDO Then let high Paradise Fall into Tartarus </s>
<s> for I shall make This world my heaven for a little space </s>
<s> The sin was mine, if any sin there was </s>
<s> 'Twas I who nurtured murder in my heart, Sweetened my meats, seasoned my wine with it, And in my fancy slew the accursed Duke A hundred times a day </s>
<s> Why, had this man Died half so often as I wished him to, Death had been stalking ever through the house, And murder had not slept </s>
<s> But you, fond heart, Whose little eyes grew tender over a whipt hound, You whom the little children laughed to see Because you brought the sunlight where you passed, You the white angel of God's purity, This which men call your sin, what was it </s>
<s> DUCHESS Ay </s>
<s> What was it </s>
<s> There are times it seems a dream, An evil dream sent by an evil god, And then I see the dead face in the coffin And know it is no dream, but that my hand Is red with blood, and that my desperate soul Striving to find some haven for its love From the wild tempest of this raging world, Has wrecked its bark upon the rocks of sin </s>
<s> What was it, said you?--murder merely </s>
<s> Nothing But murder, horrible murder </s>
<s> GUIDO Nay, nay, nay, 'Twas but the passion-flower of your love That in one moment leapt to terrible life, And in one moment bare this gory fruit, Which I had plucked in thought a thousand times </s>
<s> My soul was murderous, but my hand refused; Your hand wrought murder, but your soul was pure </s>
<s> And so I love you, Beatrice, and let him Who has no mercy for your stricken head, Lack mercy up in heaven </s>
<s> Kiss me, sweet </s>
<s> [Tries to kiss her.] DUCHESS No, no, your lips are pure, and mine are soiled, For Guilt has been my paramour, and Sin Lain in my bed: O Guido, if you love me Get hence, for every moment is a worm Which gnaws your life away: nay, sweet, get hence, And if in after time you think of me, Think of me as of one who loved you more Than anything on earth; think of me, Guido, As of a woman merely, one who tried To make her life a sacrifice to love, And slew love in the trial: Oh, what is that </s>
<s> The bell has stopped from ringing, and I hear The feet of armed men upon the stair </s>
<s> GUIDO [aside] That is the signal for the guard to come </s>
<s> DUCHESS Why has the bell stopped ringing </s>
<s> GUIDO If you must know, That stops my life on this side of the grave, But on the other we shall meet again </s>
<s> DUCHESS No, no, 'tis not too late: you must get hence; The horse is by the bridge, there is still time </s>
<s> Away, away, you must not tarry here </s>
<s> [Noise of Soldiers in the passage.] A VOICE OUTSIDE Room for the Lord Justice of Padua </s>
<s> [The LORD JUSTICE is seen through the grated window passing down the corridor preceded by men bearing torches.] DUCHESS It is too late </s>
<s> A VOICE OUTSIDE Room for the headsman </s>
<s> DUCHESS [sinks down] Oh </s>
<s> [The Headsman with his axe on his shoulder is seen passing the corridor, followed by Monks bearing candles.] GUIDO Farewell, dear love, for I must drink this poison </s>
<s> I do not fear the headsman, but I would die Not on the lonely scaffold </s>
<s> But here, Here in thine arms, kissing thy mouth: farewell </s>
<s> [Goes to the table and takes the goblet up.] What, art thou empty </s>
<s> [Throws it to the ground.] O thou churlish gaoler, Even of poisons niggard </s>
<s> DUCHESS [faintly] Blame him not </s>
<s> GUIDO O God </s>
<s> you have not drunk it, Beatrice </s>
<s> Tell me you have not </s>
<s> DUCHESS Were I to deny it, There is a fire eating at my heart Which would find utterance </s>
<s> GUIDO O treacherous love, Why have you not left a drop for me </s>
<s> DUCHESS No, no, it held but death enough for one </s>
<s> GUIDO Is there no poison still upon your lips, That I may draw it from them </s>
<s> DUCHESS Why should you die </s>
<s> You have not spilt blood, and so need not die: I have spilt blood, and therefore I must die </s>
<s> Was it not said blood should be spilt for blood </s>
<s> Who said that </s>
<s> I forget </s>
<s> GUIDO Tarry for me, Our souls will go together </s>
<s> DUCHESS Nay, you must live </s>
<s> There are many other women in the world Who will love you, and not murder for your sake </s>
<s> GUIDO I love you only </s>
<s> DUCHESS You need not die for that </s>
<s> GUIDO Ah, if we die together, love, why then Can we not lie together in one grave </s>
<s> DUCHESS A grave is but a narrow wedding-bed </s>
<s> GUIDO It is enough for us DUCHESS And they will strew it With a stark winding-sheet, and bitter herbs: I think there are no roses in the grave, Or if there are, they all are withered now Since my Lord went there </s>
<s> GUIDO Ah </s>
<s> dear Beatrice, Your lips are roses that death cannot wither </s>
<s> DUCHESS Nay, if we lie together, will not my lips Fall into dust, and your enamoured eyes Shrivel to sightless sockets, and the worms, Which are our groomsmen, eat away your heart </s>
<s> GUIDO I do not care: Death has no power on love </s>
<s> And so by Love's immortal sovereignty I will die with you </s>
<s> DUCHESS But the grave is black, And the pit black, so I must go before To light the candles for your coming hither </s>
<s> No, no, I will not die, I will not die </s>
<s> Love, you are strong, and young, and very brave; Stand between me and the angel of death, And wrestle with him for me </s>
<s> [Thrusts GUIDO in front of her with his back to the audience.] I will kiss you, When you have thrown him </s>
<s> Oh, have you no cordial, To stay the workings of this poison in me </s>
<s> Are there no rivers left in Italy That you will not fetch me one cup of water To quench this fire </s>
<s> GUIDO O God </s>
<s> DUCHESS You did not tell me There was a drought in Italy, and no water: Nothing but fire </s>
<s> GUIDO O Love </s>
<s> DUCHESS Send for a leech, Not him who stanched my husband, but another We have no time: send for a leech, I say: There is an antidote against each poison, And he will sell it if we give him money </s>
<s> Tell him that I will give him Padua, For one short hour of life: I will not die </s>
<s> Oh, I am sick to death; no, do not touch me, This poison gnaws my heart: I did not know It was such pain to die: I thought that life Had taken all the agonies to itself; It seems it is not so </s>
<s> GUIDO O damned stars Quench your vile cresset-lights in tears, and bid The moon, your mistress, shine no more to-night </s>
<s> DUCHESS Guido, why are we here </s>
<s> I think this room Is poorly furnished for a marriage chamber </s>
<s> Let us get hence at once </s>
<s> Where are the horses </s>
<s> We should be on our way to Venice now </s>
<s> How cold the night is </s>
<s> We must ride faster </s>
<s> [The Monks begin to chant outside.] Music </s>
<s> It should be merrier; but grief Is of the fashion now--I know not why </s>
<s> You must not weep: do we not love each other </s>
<s> - That is enough </s>
<s> Death, what do you here </s>
<s> You were not bidden to this table, sir; Away, we have no need of you: I tell you It was in wine I pledged you, not in poison </s>
<s> They lied who told you that I drank your poison </s>
<s> It was spilt upon the ground, like my Lord's blood; You came too late </s>
<s> GUIDO Sweet, there is nothing there: These things are only unreal shadows </s>
<s> DUCHESS Death, Why do you tarry, get to the upper chamber; The cold meats of my husband's funeral feast Are set for you; this is a wedding feast </s>
<s> You are out of place, sir; and, besides, 'tis summer </s>
<s> We do not need these heavy fires now, You scorch us </s>
<s> Oh, I am burned up, Can you do nothing </s>
<s> Water, give me water, Or else more poison </s>
<s> No: I feel no pain - Is it not curious I should feel no pain </s>
<s> - And Death has gone away, I am glad of that </s>
<s> I thought he meant to part us </s>
<s> Tell me, Guido, Are you not sorry that you ever saw me </s>
<s> GUIDO I swear I would not have lived otherwise </s>
<s> Why, in this dull and common world of ours Men have died looking for such moments as this And have not found them </s>
<s> DUCHESS Then you are not sorry </s>
<s> How strange that seems </s>
<s> GUIDO What, Beatrice, have I not Stood face to face with beauty </s>
<s> That is enough For one man's life </s>
<s> Why, love, I could be merry; I have been often sadder at a feast, But who were sad at such a feast as this When Love and Death are both our cup-bearers </s>
<s> We love and die together </s>
<s> DUCHESS Oh, I have been Guilty beyond all women, and indeed Beyond all women punished </s>
<s> Do you think - No, that could not be--Oh, do you think that love Can wipe the bloody stain from off my hands, Pour balm into my wounds, heal up my hurts, And wash my scarlet sins as white as snow </s>
<s> - For I have sinned </s>
<s> GUIDO They do not sin at all Who sin for love </s>
<s> DUCHESS No, I have sinned, and yet Perchance my sin will be forgiven me </s>
<s> I have loved much [They kiss each other now for the first time in this Act, when suddenly the DUCHESS leaps up in the dreadful spasm of death, tears in agony at her dress, and finally, with face twisted and distorted with pain, falls back dead in a chair </s>
<s> GUIDO seizing her dagger from her belt, kills himself; and, as he falls across her knees, clutches at the cloak which is on the back of the chair, and throws it entirely over her </s>
<s> There is a little pause </s>
<s> Then down the passage comes the tramp of Soldiers; the door is opened, and the LORD JUSTICE, the Headsman, and the Guard enter and see this figure shrouded in black, and GUIDO lying dead across her </s>
<s> The LORD JUSTICE rushes forward and drags the cloak off the DUCHESS, whose face is now the marble image of peace, the sign of God's forgiveness.] Tableau CURTAIN </s>
