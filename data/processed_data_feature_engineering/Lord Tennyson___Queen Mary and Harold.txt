<s> Did you hear (I have a daughter in her service who reported it) that she met the Queen at Wanstead with five hundred horse, and the Queen (tho' some say they be much divided) took her hand, call'd her sweet sister, and kiss'd not her alone, but all the ladies of her following </s>
<s> SECOND GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> Ay, that was in her hour of joy; there will be plenty to sunder and unsister them again: this Gardiner for one, who is to be made Lord Chancellor, and will pounce like a wild beast out of his cage to worry Cranmer </s>
<s> FIRST GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> And furthermore, my daughter said that when there rose a talk of the late rebellion, she spoke even of Northumberland pitifully, and of the good Lady Jane as a poor innocent child who had but obeyed her father; and furthermore, she said that no one in her time should be burnt for heresy </s>
<s> SECOND GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> Well, sir, I look for happy times </s>
<s> FIRST GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> There is but one thing against them </s>
<s> I know not if you know </s>

<s> I suppose you touch upon the rumour that Charles, the master of the world, has offer'd her his son Philip, the Pope and the Devil </s>

<s> She is going now to the Tower to loose the prisoners there, and among them Courtenay, to be made Earl of Devon, of royal blood, of splendid feature, whom the council and all her people wish her to marry </s>
<s> May it be so, for we are many of us Catholics, but few Papists, and the Hot Gospellers will go mad upon it </s>

<s> Was she not betroth'd in her babyhood to the Great Emperor himself </s>
<s> FIRST GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> Ay, but he's too old </s>
<s> SECOND GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> And again to her cousin Reginald Pole, now Cardinal; but I hear that he too is full of aches and broken before his day </s>

<s> No, Renard; it must never come to this </s>

<s> MARY </s>

<s> They would not have me wed the Prince of Spain: That was their pretext--so they spake at first-- But we sent divers of our Council to them, And by their answers to the question ask'd, It doth appear this marriage is the least Of all their quarrel </s>
<s> They have betrayed the treason of their hearts: Seek to possess our person, hold our Tower, Place and displace our councillors, and use Both us and them according as they will </s>
<s> Now what I am ye know right well--your Queen; To whom, when I was wedded to the realm And the realm's laws (the spousal ring whereof, Not ever to be laid aside, I wear Upon this finger), ye did promise full Allegiance and obedience to the death </s>

<s> Now as your Prince, I say, I, that was never mother, cannot tell How mothers love their children; yet, methinks, A prince as naturally may love his people As these their children; and be sure your Queen So loves you, and so loving, needs must deem This love by you return'd as heartily; And thro' this common knot and bond of love, Doubt not they will be speedily overthrown </s>
<s> As to this marriage, ye shall understand We made thereto no treaty of ourselves, And set no foot theretoward unadvised Of all our Privy Council; furthermore, This marriage had the assent of those to whom The king, my father, did commit his trust; Who not alone esteem'd it honourable, But for the wealth and glory of our realm, And all our loving subjects, most expedient </s>

<s> Yet if it might please God that I should leave Some fruit of mine own body after me, To be your king, ye would rejoice thereat, And it would be your comfort, as I trust; And truly, if I either thought or knew This marriage should bring loss or danger to you, My subjects, or impair in any way This royal state of England, I would never Consent thereto, nor marry while I live; Moreover, if this marriage should not seem, Before our own High Court of Parliament, To be of rich advantage to our realm, We will refrain, and not alone from this, Likewise from any other, out of which Looms the least chance of peril to our realm </s>

<s> It is Sir Ralph, And muttering to himself as heretofore </s>
<s> Sir, see you aught up yonder </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> I miss something </s>

<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> Well, the tree in Virgil, sir, That bears not its own apples </s>

<s> What </s>
<s> the gallows </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> Sir, this dead fruit was ripening overmuch, And had to be removed lest living Spain Should sicken at dead England </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> Not so dead, But that a shock may rouse her </s>

<s> Stafford, I am a sad man and a serious </s>
<s> Far liefer had I in my country hall Been reading some old book, with mine old hound Couch'd at my hearth, and mine old flask of wine Beside me, than have seen it: yet I saw it </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> Good, was it splendid </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> Ay, if Dukes, and Earls, And Counts, and sixty Spanish cavaliers, Some six or seven Bishops, diamonds, pearls, That royal commonplace too, cloth of gold, Could make it so </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> And what was Mary's dress </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> Good faith, I was too sorry for the woman To mark the dress </s>
<s> She wore red shoes </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> Red shoes </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>

<s> France </s>

<s> Sir, no woman's regimen Can save us </s>
<s> We are fallen, and as I think, Never to rise again </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> You are too black-blooded </s>
<s> I'd make a move myself to hinder that: I know some lusty fellows there in France </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> You would but make us weaker, Thomas Stafford </s>
<s> Wyatt was a good soldier, yet he fail'd, And strengthen'd Philip </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> Did not his last breath Clear Courtenay and the Princess from the charge Of being his co-rebels </s>
<s> BAGENHALL </s>
<s> Ay, but then What such a one as Wyatt says is nothing: We have no men among us </s>
<s> The new Lords Are quieted with their sop of Abbeylands, And ev'n before the Queen's face Gardiner buys them With Philip's gold </s>
<s> All greed, no faith, no courage </s>
<s> Why, ev'n the haughty prince, Northumberland, The leader of our Reformation, knelt And blubber'd like a lad, and on the scaffold Recanted, and resold himself to Rome </s>
<s> STAFFORD </s>
<s> I swear you do your country wrong, Sir Ralph </s>
<s> I know a set of exiles over there, Dare-devils, that would eat fire and spit it out At Philip's beard: they pillage Spain already </s>

<s> No men </s>
<s> Did not Lord Suffolk die like a true man </s>

<s> My foreign friends, who dream'd us blanketed In ever-closing fog, were much amazed To find as fair a sun as might have flash'd Upon their lake of Garda, fire the Thames; Our voyage by sea was all but miracle; And here the river flowing from the sea, Not toward it (for they thought not of our tides), Seem'd as a happy miracle to make glide-- In quiet--home your banish'd countryman </s>
