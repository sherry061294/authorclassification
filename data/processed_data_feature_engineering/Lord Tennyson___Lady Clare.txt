<s> Garrett Lady Clare It was the time when lilies blow, And clouds are highest up in air </s>
<s> Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe To give his cousin, Lady Clare </s>
<s> I trow they did not part in scorn: Lovers long betrothed were they; They two will wed the morrow morn; God's blessing on the day </s>
<s> "He does not love me for my birth Nor for my lands so broad and fair; He loves me for my own true worth, And that is well," said Lady Clare </s>
<s> In there came old Alice the nurse, Said, "Who was this that went from thee" </s>
<s> "It was my cousin," said Lady Clare; "To-morrow he weds with me" </s>
<s> "Oh, God be thanked" </s>
<s> said Alice the nurse, "That all comes round so just and fair: Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands, And you are not the Lady Clare" </s>
<s> "Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse," Said Lady Clare, "that ye speak so wild" </s>
<s> "As God's above," said Alice the nurse, "I speak the truth: you are my child </s>
<s> The old earl's daughter died at my breast; I speak the truth, as I live by bread </s>
<s> I buried her like my own sweet child, And put my child in her stead" </s>
<s> "Falsely, falsely have ye done, O mother," she said, "if this be true, To keep the best man under the sun So many years from his due" </s>
<s> "Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse, "But keep the secret for your life, And all you have will be Lord Ronald's, When you are man and wife" </s>
<s> "If I'm a beggar born," she said "I will speak out, for I dare not lie, Pull off, pull off the brooch of gold, And fling the diamond necklace by" </s>
<s> "Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse, "But keep the secret all you can" </s>
<s> She said, "Not so; but I will know If there be any faith in man" </s>
<s> "Nay now, what faith" </s>
<s> said Alice the nurse, "The man will cleave unto his right" </s>
<s> "And he shall have it," the lady replied, "Though I should die to-night" </s>
<s> "Yet give one kiss to your mother, dear </s>
<s> Alas, my child </s>
<s> I sinned for thee" </s>
<s> "O mother, mother, mother," she said, "So strange it seems to me </s>
<s> "Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear, My mother dear, if this be so, And lay your hand upon my head, And bless me, mother, ere I go" </s>
<s> She clad herself in a russen gown, She was no longer Lady Clare: She went by dale, and she went by down, With a single rose in her hair </s>
<s> The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought Leapt up from where she lay </s>
<s> Dropped her head in the maiden's hand </s>
<s> And followed her all the way </s>
<s> Down stepped Lord Ronald from his tower: "O Lady Clare, you shame your worth </s>
<s> Why come you dressed like a village maid, That are the flower of the earth" </s>
<s> "If I come dressed like a village maid, I am but as my fortunes are: I am a begger born," she said, "And not the Lady Clare" </s>
<s> "Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald, "For I am yours in word and in deed; Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald, "Your riddle is hard to read" </s>
<s> Oh, and proudly stood she up </s>
<s> Her heart within her did not fail: She looked into Lord Ronald's eyes, And told him all her nurse's tale </s>
<s> He laughed a laugh of merry scorn: He turned and kissed her where she stood; "If you are not the heiress born, And I," said he, "the next in blood-- "If you are not the heiress born, And I," said he, "the lawful heir, We two will wed to-morrow morn, And you shall still be Lady Clare" </s>
