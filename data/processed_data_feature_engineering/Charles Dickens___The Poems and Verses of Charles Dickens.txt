<s> Heavenly Father, 133 SONGS, CHORUSES, AND CONCERTED PIECES FROM 'THE VILLAGE COQUETTES' A COMIC OPERA 1836 THE VILLAGE COQUETTES About the year 1834, when the earliest of the _Sketches by Boz_ were appearing in print, a young composer named John Hullah set to music a portion of an opera called _The Gondolier_, which he thought might prove successful on the stage </s>
<s> Twelve months later Hullah became acquainted with Charles Dickens, whose name was then unknown to those outside his own immediate circle, and it occurred to him that he and 'Boz' might combine their forces by converting _The Gondolier_ into a popular play </s>
<s> Dickens, who always entertained a passion for the theatre, entered into the project at once, and informed Hullah that he had a little unpublished story by him which he thought would dramatise well--even better than _The Gondolier_ notion; confessing that he would rather deal with familiar English scenes than with the unfamiliar Venetian environment of the play favoured by Hullah </s>
<s> The title of _The Gondolier_ was consequently abandoned, and a novel subject found and put forward as _The Village Coquettes_, a comic opera of which songs, duets, and concerted pieces were to form constituent parts </s>
<s> Dickens, of course, became responsible for the _libretto_ and Hullah for the music; and when completed the little play was offered to, and accepted by, Braham, the lessee of the St </s>
<s> James's Theatre, who expressed an earnest desire to be the first to introduce 'Boz' to the public as a dramatic writer </s>
<s> A favourite comedian of that day, John Pritt Harley, after reading the words of the opera prior to its representation, declared it was 'a sure card,' and felt so confident of its success that he offered to wager ten pounds that it would run fifty nights!--an assurance which at once decided Braham to produce it </s>
<s> _The Village Coquettes_, described on the title-page of the printed copies as 'A Comic Opera, in Two Acts,' was played for the first time on December 6, 1836, with Braham and Harley in the cast </s>
<s> In his preface to the play (published contemporaneously by Richard Bentley, and dedicated to Harley) Dickens explained that 'the _libretto_ of an opera must be, to a certain extent, a mere vehicle for the music,' and that 'it is scarcely fair or reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be justly applicable to a five-act tragedy or a finished comedy' </s>
<s> There is no doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to Hullah's music rather than upon the play itself, and it is said that Harley's reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of them </s>
<s> _The Village Coquettes_ enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in London during the season, and was then transferred to Edinburgh, where it was performed under the management of Mr Ramsay, a friend of Sir Walter Scott </s>
<s> Sala, as a boy of ten, witnessed its first representation in London, and ever retained a vivid impression of the event; while especial interest appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first bringing Dickens into personal communication with John Forster, his life-long friend and biographer </s>
<s> It is more than probable that 'Boz' felt a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the 'dramatic bantling,' but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth </s>
<s> Indeed, when in 1843 it was proposed to revive the play, he expressed a hope that it might be allowed 'to sink into its native obscurity' </s>
<s> 'I did it,' he explained, 'in a fit of damnable good-nature long ago, for Hullah, who wrote some very pretty music to it </s>
<s> I just put down for everybody what everybody at the St </s>
<s> James's Theatre wanted to say and do, and what they could say and do best, and I have been most sincerely repentant ever since' </s>
<s> The novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce called _The Strange Gentleman_ (the latter written as 'a practical joke' for the St </s>
<s> James's Theatre about the same time) were done 'without the least consideration or regard to reputation'; he also declared that he 'wouldn't repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece,' and devoutly wished these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten </s>
<s> _À propos_ of this, the late Frederick Locker-Lampson has recorded that when he asked Dickens (about a year before the great writer's death) whether he possessed a copy of _The Village Coquettes_, his reply was, 'No; and if I knew it was in my house, and if I could not get rid of it in any other way, I would burn the wing of the house where it was' </s>
<s> Although, perhaps, not of a high order of merit, _The Village Coquettes_ is not without bibliographical interest, and may be regarded as a musical and literary curiosity </s>
<s> Copies of the first edition of the little play are now seldom met with, and whenever a perfect impression comes into the market it commands a good price, even as much as £10 or £12,--indeed, a particularly fine copy was sold at Sotheby's in 1889 for twenty-five pounds </s>
<s> In 1878 the words of the opera were reprinted in facsimile by Richard Bentley, for which a frontispiece was etched by F </s>

<s> THE VILLAGE COQUETTES ROUND Hail to the merry Autumn days, when yellow corn-fields shine, Far brighter than the costly cup that holds the monarch's wine </s>
<s> Hail to the merry harvest time, the gayest of the year, The time of rich and bounteous crops, rejoicing, and good cheer </s>
<s> 'Tis pleasant on a fine Spring morn to see the buds expand, 'Tis pleasant in the Summer time to view the teeming land; 'Tis pleasant on a Winter's night to crouch around the blaze,-- But what are joys like these, my boys, to Autumn's merry days </s>
<s> Then hail to merry Autumn days, when yellow corn-fields shine, Far brighter than the costly cup that holds the monarch's wine </s>
<s> And hail to merry harvest time, the gayest of the year, The time of rich and bounteous crops, rejoicing, and good cheer </s>
<s> LUCY'S SONG Love is not a feeling to pass away, Like the balmy breath of a summer day; It is not--it cannot be--laid aside; It is not a thing to forget or hide </s>
<s> It clings to the heart, ah, woe is me </s>
<s> As the ivy clings to the old oak tree </s>
<s> Love is not a passion of earthly mould, As a thirst for honour, or fame, or gold: For when all these wishes have died away, The deep strong love of a brighter day, Though nourished in secret, consumes the more, As the slow rust eats to the iron's core </s>
<s> SQUIRE NORTON'S SONG That very wise head, old Æsop, said, The bow should be sometimes loose; Keep it tight for ever, the string you sever:-- Let's turn his old moral to use </s>
<s> The world forget, and let us yet, The glass our spirits buoying, Revel to-night in those moments bright Which make life worth enjoying </s>
<s> The cares of the day, old moralists say, Are quite enough to perplex one; Then drive to-day's sorrow away till to-morrow, And then put it off till the next one </s>
<s> _Chorus_--The cares of the day, etc Some plodding old crones, the heartless drones </s>
<s> Appeal to my cool reflection, And ask me whether such nights can ever Charm sober recollection </s>
<s> Yes, yes </s>

<s> How like those hopes in their decay-- How faded are they now </s>
<s> Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, lie strewn around me here; Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, how sad, how cold, how drear </s>
<s> Wither'd leaves, wither'd leaves, that fly before the gale: Withered leaves, withered leaves, ye tell a mournful tale, Of love once true, and friends once kind, And happy moments fled: Dispersed by every breath of wind, Forgotten, changed, or dead </s>

<s> Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, how sad, how cold, how drear </s>
<s> ROSE'S SONG Some folks who have grown old and sour, Say love does nothing but annoy </s>
<s> The fact is, they have had their hour, So envy what they can't enjoy </s>
<s> I like the glance--I like the sigh-- That does of ardent passion tell </s>
<s> If some folks were as young as I, I'm sure they'd like it quite as well </s>
<s> Old maiden aunts so hate the men, So well know how wives are harried, It makes them sad--not jealous--when They see their poor dear nieces married </s>
<s> All men are fair and false, they know, And with deep sighs they assail 'em, It's so long since they tried men, though, I rather think their mem'ries fail 'em </s>
<s> DUET (_Flam and Rose_) _Flam._ 'Tis true I'm caressed by the witty, The envy of all the fine beaux, The pet of the court and the city, But still, I'm the lover of Rose </s>
<s> _Rose._ Country sweethearts, oh, how I despise </s>

<s> _Both._ Then let us be happy together, Content with the world as it goes, An unchangeable couple for ever, Mr Flam and his beautiful Rose </s>
<s> SQUIRE NORTON'S SONG The child and the old man sat alone In the quiet, peaceful shade Of the old green boughs, that had richly grown In the deep, thick forest glade </s>
<s> It was a soft and pleasant sound, That rustling of the oak; And the gentle breeze played lightly round, As thus the fair boy spoke:-- 'Dear father, what can honour be, Of which I hear men rave </s>
<s> Field, cell and cloister, land and sea, The tempest and the grave:-- It lives in all, 'tis sought in each, 'Tis never heard or seen: Now tell me, father, I beseech, What can this honour mean' </s>
<s> 'It is a name--a name, my child,-- It lived in other days, When men were rude, their passions wild, Their sport, thick battle-frays </s>

<s> 'The iron hearts of that old day Have mouldered in the grave; And chivalry has passed away, With knights so true and brave; The honour, which to them was life, Throbs in no bosom now; It only gilds the gambler's strife, Or decks the worthless vow' </s>

<s> LYRIC FROM 'THE LAMPLIGHTER' A FARCE 1838 THE LAMPLIGHTER In 1838 Dickens agreed to prepare a little play for Macready, the famous actor, then the manager of Drury Lane Theatre </s>
<s> It was called _The Lamplighter_, and when completed the author read aloud the 'unfortunate little farce' (as he subsequently termed it) in the greenroom of the theatre </s>
<s> Although the play went through rehearsal, it was never presented before an audience, for the actors would not agree about it, and, at Macready's suggestion, Dickens consented to withdraw it, declaring that he had 'no other feeling of disappointment connected with this matter' but that which arose from the failure in attempting to serve his friend </s>
<s> The manuscript of the play, not in Dickens's handwriting, reposes in the Forster Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and in 1879 it was printed for the first time, in the form of a pamphlet, of which only two hundred and fifty copies were issued </s>
<s> When rejected by Macready as unsuitable for stage presentation, _The Lamplighter_ was adapted by Dickens to another purpose--that is to say, he converted it into a tale called _The Lamplighter's Story_, for publication in _The Pic-Nic Papers_, issued in 1841 for the benefit of the widow of Macrone, Dickens's first publisher, who died in great poverty </s>
<s> Between the farce and the story there are but slight differences </s>
<s> The duet of two verses, sung by Tom and Betsy to the air of 'The Young May-moon,' cannot of course be regarded as a remarkable composition, but it served its purpose sufficiently well, and for that reason deserves recognition </s>

<s> SONGS FROM 'THE PICKWICK PAPERS' 1837 I.--THE IVY GREEN THE IVY GREEN This famous ballad of three verses, from the sixth chapter of _Pickwick_, is perhaps the most acceptable of all Dickens's poetical efforts </s>
<s> It was originally set to music, at Dickens's request, by his brother-in-law, Henry Burnett, a professional vocalist, who, by the way, was the admitted prototype of Nicholas Nickleby </s>
<s> Mr Burnett sang the ballad scores of times in the presence of literary men and artists, and it proved an especial favourite with Landor </s>
<s> 'The Ivy Green' was not written for _Pickwick_, Mr Burnett assured me; but on its being so much admired the author said it should go into a monthly number, and it did </s>
<s> The most popular setting is undoubtedly that of Henry Russell, who has recorded that he received, as his fee, the magnificent sum of ten shillings </s>
<s> The ballad, in this form, went into many editions, and the sales must have amounted to tens of thousands </s>
<s> THE IVY GREEN Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green, That creepeth o'er ruins old </s>
<s> Of right choice food are his meals, I ween, In his cell so lone and cold </s>
<s> The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed, To pleasure his dainty whim: And the mouldering dust that years have made Is a merry meal for him </s>
<s> Creeping where no life is seen, A rare old plant is the Ivy green </s>
<s> Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings, And a staunch old heart has he </s>
<s> How closely he twineth, how tight he clings, To his friend the huge Oak Tree </s>
<s> And slily he traileth along the ground, And his leaves he gently waves, As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men's graves </s>
<s> Creeping where grim death hath been, A rare old plant is the Ivy green </s>
<s> Whole ages have fled and their works decayed, And nations have scattered been; But the stout old Ivy shall never fade, From its hale and hearty green </s>
<s> The brave old plant, in its lonely days, Shall fatten upon the past: For the stateliest building man can raise Is the Ivy's food at last </s>
<s> Creeping on, where time has been, A rare old plant is the Ivy green </s>
<s> II.--A CHRISTMAS CAROL A CHRISTMAS CAROL The five stanzas bearing the above title will be found in the twenty-eighth chapter of _Pickwick_, where they are introduced as the song which that hospitable old soul, Mr Wardle, sung appropriately, 'in a good, round, sturdy voice,' before the Pickwickians and others assembled on Christmas Eve at Manor Farm </s>

<s> A CHRISTMAS CAROL I care not for Spring; on his fickle wing Let the blossoms and buds be borne: He woos them amain with his treacherous rain, And he scatters them ere the morn </s>
<s> An inconstant elf, he knows not himself Nor his own changing mind an hour, He'll smile in your face, and, with wry grimace, He'll wither your youngest flower </s>
<s> Let the Summer sun to his bright home run, He shall never be sought by me; When he's dimmed by a cloud I can laugh aloud, And care not how sulky he be </s>
<s> For his darling child is the madness wild That sports in fierce fever's train; And when love is too strong, it don't last long, As many have found to their pain </s>
<s> A mild harvest night, by the tranquil light Of the modest and gentle moon, Has a far sweeter sheen, for me, I ween, Than the broad and unblushing noon </s>
<s> But every leaf awakens my grief, As it lieth beneath the tree; So let Autumn air be never so fair, It by no means agrees with me </s>
<s> But my song I troll out, for CHRISTMAS stout, The hearty, the true, and the bold; A bumper I drain, and with might and main Give three cheers for this Christmas old </s>
<s> We'll usher him in with a merry din That shall gladden his joyous heart, And we'll keep him up, while there's bite or sup, And in fellowship good, we'll part </s>
<s> In his fine honest pride, he scorns to hide One jot of his hard-weather scars; They're no disgrace, for there's much the same trace On the cheeks of our bravest tars </s>

<s> III.--GABRIEL GRUB'S SONG GABRIEL GRUB'S SONG The Sexton's melancholy dirge, in the twenty-ninth chapter of _Pickwick_, seems a little incongruous in a humorous work </s>
<s> The sentiment, however, thoroughly accords with the philosophic gravedigger's gruesome occupation </s>
<s> 'The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton' is one of several short tales (chiefly of a dismal character) introduced into _Pickwick_; they were doubtless written prior to the conception of _Pickwick_, each being probably intended for independent publication, and in a manner similar to the 'Boz' Sketches </s>

<s> Dickens took great interest in the young man and indicated a desire to promote the welfare of his production by composing some introductory lines </s>

<s> If, on consideration, you should agree with me, I will write the prologue, heartily' </s>
<s> Happily for the author, his little tragedy was the first new play of the season, and it thus attracted greater attention </s>
<s> Its initial representation took place at Drury Lane Theatre on December 10, 1842, and the fact that Dickens's dignified and vigorous lines were recited by Macready, the leading actor of his day, undoubtedly gave _prestige_ to this performance; but the play, although it made a sensation for the moment, did not enjoy a long run, its motive being for some reason misunderstood </s>
<s> As explained by the Editors of _The Letters of Charles Dickens_, it was (to a certain extent) an experiment in testing the effect of a tragedy of modern times and in modern dress, the novelist's Prologue being intended to show that there need be no incongruity between plain clothes of the nineteenth century and high tragedy </s>
<s> _The Patrician's Daughter: A Tragedy in Five Acts_, appeared in pamphlet form during the year prior to its being placed upon the boards </s>

<s> By the kind permission of Miss Hogarth, the lines are here reproduced from the revised and only correct version in _The Letters of Charles Dickens_ </s>
<s> In the preface to the second edition of the play (1842), the author thus acknowledges his indebtedness to Dickens for the Prologue, which, however, does not appear in the book: 'How shall I thank Mr Dickens for the spontaneous kindness which has furnished me with so excellent a letter of introduction to the audience </s>

<s> Her ladyship, through her personal charm and natural gifts, succeeded in securing the services of eminent authors for the aristocratic publication; even Dickens could not resist her appeal, and in a letter to Forster (dated July 1843) he wrote: 'I have heard, as you have, from Lady Blessington, for whose behalf I have this morning penned the lines I send you herewith </s>
<s> But I have only done so to excuse myself, for I have not the least idea of their suiting her; and I hope she will send them back to you for _The Examiner_' </s>

<s> PROLOGUE TO WILKIE COLLINS'S PLAY 'THE FROZEN DEEP' 1856 'THE FROZEN DEEP' The second drama written by Wilkie Collins for the Tavistock House Theatre was first acted there in January 1857, and subsequently at the Gallery of Illustration in the presence of Queen Victoria and the Royal Family </s>
<s> As in the case of _The Lighthouse_, the play had the advantage of a Prologue in rhyme by Charles Dickens, who again electrified his audiences by marvellous acting, the character of Richard Wardour (a young naval officer) being selected by him for representation </s>
<s> The Prologue was recited at Tavistock House by John Forster, and at the public performances of the play by Dickens himself </s>
<s> It is not generally known that a by no means inconsiderable portion of the drama was composed by Dickens, as testified by the original manuscripts of the play and of the prompt-book, which contain numerous additions and corrections in his handwriting </s>
<s> These manuscripts, by the way, realised £300 at Sotheby's in 1890 </s>
<s> The main idea of _A Tale of Two Cities_ was conceived by Dickens when performing in _The Frozen Deep_ </s>
<s> 'A strong desire was upon me then,' he writes in the preface to the story, 'to embody it in my own person; and I traced out in my fancy the state of mind of which it would necessitate the presentation to an observant spectator, with particular care and interest </s>
<s> As the idea became familiar to me, it gradually shaped itself into its present form </s>
<s> Throughout its execution, it has had complete possession of me: I have so far verified what is done and suffered in these pages, as that I have certainly done and suffered it all myself' </s>

<s> In acknowledging the receipt of the letter, Dickens observed that such a mark of approval was none the less gratifying to him because he was himself the author of the Hymn </s>
<s> 'There cannot be many men, I believe,' he added, 'who have a more humble veneration for the New Testament, or a more profound conviction of its all-sufficiency, than I have </s>
<s> If I am ever (as you tell me I am) mistaken on this subject, it is because I discountenance all obtrusive professions of and tradings in religion, as one of the main causes why real Christianity has been retarded in this world; and because my observation of life induces me to hold in unspeakable dread and horror those unseemly squabbles about the letter which drive the spirit out of hundreds of thousands'.--_Vide_ Forster's _Life of Charles Dickens_, Book XI </s>
