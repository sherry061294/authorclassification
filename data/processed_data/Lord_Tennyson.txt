<s> </s>
<s> on his travels in greece was added </s>
<s> this edition the eighth may be regarded as the final one </s>
<s> nothing afterwards of much importance was added or subtracted and comparatively few alterations were made in the text from that date to the last collected edition in </s>
<s> all the editions up to and including that of have been carefully collated so that the student of tennyson can follow step by step the process by which he arrived at that perfection of expression which is perhaps his most striking characteristic as poet </s>
<s> and it was indeed trophy of labour of the application of patient touches of unwearied art </s>
<s> whoever will turn say to the palace of art to none to the dream of fair women or even to the sea fairies and to the lady of shalott will see what labour was expended on their composition </s>
<s> nothing indeed can be more interesting than to note the touches the substitution of which measured the whole distance between mediocrity and excellence </s>
<s> take for example the magical alteration in the couplet in the dream of fair women one drew sharp knife thro my tender throat slowly and nothing more into the bright death quiver'd at the victim's throat touch'd and knew no more </s>
<s> or in the same poem what nights we had in egypt </s>
<s> could hit his humours while cross'd him </s>
<s> the life led him and the dalliance and the wit into we drank the libyan sun to sleep and lit lamps which outburn'd canopus </s>
<s> my life in egypt </s>

<s> or in mariana in the south she mov'd her lips she pray'd alone she praying disarray'd and warm from slumber deep her wavy form in the dark lustrous mirror shone into complaining mother give me grace to help me of my weary load </s>
<s> and on the liquid mirror glow'd the clear perfection of her face </s>
<s> how happy is this slight alteration in the verses to </s>
<s> which corrects one of the falsest notes ever struck by poet tear dropt on my tablets as wrote </s>
<s> tear dropt on the letters as wrote </s>
<s> or where in locksley hall splendidly graphic touch of description is gained by the alteration of droops the trailer from the crag into swings the trailer </s>
<s> so again in love and duty should my shadow cross thy thoughts too sadly for their peace so put it back </s>
<s> for calmer hours in memory's darkest hold where by altering so put it back into remand it thou somewhat ludicrous image is at all events softened </s>
<s> what great care tennyson took with his phraseology is curiously illustrated in the may queen </s>
<s> in the edition robin was the name of the may queen's lover </s>
<s> in it was altered to robert and in and subsequent editions back to robin </s>
<s> compare again the old stanza in the miller's daughter how dear to me in youth my love was everything about the mill the black and silent pool above the pool beneath it never still with what was afterwards substituted loved the brimming wave that swam through quiet meadows round the mill the sleepy pool above the dam the pool beneath it never still </s>
<s> another most felicitous emendation is to be found in the poet where the edition of reads and in the bordure of her robe was writ wisdom name to shake hoar anarchies as with thunderfit </s>
<s> this in appears as and in her raiment's hem was trac'd in flame wisdom name to shake all evil dreams of power sacred name </s>
<s> again in the lotos eaters three thunder cloven thrones of oldest snow stood sunset flushed is changed into three silent pinnacles of aged snow </s>
<s> so in will waterproof the cumbrous like hezekiah's backward runs the shadow of my days was afterwards simplified into against its fountain upward runs the current of my days </s>
<s> not less felicitous have been the additions made from time to time </s>
<s> thus in audley court the concluding lines ran the harbour buoy with one green sparkle ever and anon dipt by itself </s>
<s> but what vividness is there in the subsequent insertion of sole star of phosphorescence in the calm between the first line and the second </s>
<s> so again in the morte d'arthur how greatly are imagery and rhythm improved by the insertion of across the ridge and paced beside the mere between then went sir bedivere the second time and counting the dewy pebbles fix'd in thought </s>
<s> there is an alteration in none which is very interesting </s>
<s> till this was allowed to stand the lizard with his shadow on the stone rests like shadow and the cicala sleeps </s>
<s> no one could have known better than tennyson that the cicala is loudest in the torrid calm of the noonday as theocritus virgil byron and innumerable other poets have noticed at last he altered it but at the heavy price of cumbrous pleonasm into and the winds are dead </s>
<s> he allowed many years to elapse before he corrected another error in natural history but at last the alteration came </s>
<s> in the poet's song in the line the swallow stopt as he hunted the bee the fly which the swallow does hunt was substituted for what it does not hunt and that for very obvious reasons </s>
<s> but whoever would see what tennyson's poetry has owed to elaborate revision and scrupulous care would do well to compare the first edition of mariana in the south the sea fairies oenone the lady of shalott the palace of art and dream of fair women with the poems as they are presented in </s>
<s> poets do not always improve their verses by revision as all students of wordsworth's text could abundantly illustrate but it may be doubted whether in these poems at least tennyson ever made single alteration which was not for the better </s>
<s> fitzgerald indeed contended that in some cases particularly in the miller's daughter tennyson would have done well to let the first reading stand but few critics would agree with him in the instances he gives </s>
<s> we may perhaps regret the sacrifice of such stanza as this each coltsfoot down the grassy bent whose round leaves hold the gathered shower each quaintly folded cuckoo pint and silver paly cuckoo flower </s>
<s> ii tennyson's genius was slow in maturing </s>
<s> the poems contributed by him to the volume of poems by two brothers are not without some slight promise but are very far from indicating extraordinary powers </s>
<s> great advance is discernible in timbuctoo but that matthew arnold should have discovered in it the germ of tennyson's future powers is probably to be attributed to the youth of the critic </s>
<s> tennyson was in his twenty second year when the poems chiefly lyrical appeared and what strikes us in these poems is certainly not what arthur hallam saw in them much rather what coleridge and wilson discerned in them </s>
<s> they are the poems of fragile and somewhat morbid young man in whose temper we seem to see touch of hamlet touch of romeo and more healthily touch of mercutio </s>
<s> their most promising characteristic is the versatility displayed </s>
<s> thus we find mariana side by side with the supposed confessions the ode to memory with greek oi rheontes the ballad of oriana with the dying swan recollections of the arabian nights with the poet </s>
<s> their worst fault is affectation </s>
<s> perhaps the utmost that can be said for them is that they display fine but somewhat thin vein of original genius after deducing what they owe to coleridge to keats and to other poets </s>
<s> this is seen in the magical touches of description in the exquisite felicity of expression and rhythm which frequently mark them in the pathos and power of such poem as oriana in the pathos and charm of such poems as mariana and dirge in the rich and almost gorgeous fancy displayed in the recollections </s>
<s> the poems of are much more ambitious and strike deeper notes </s>
<s> here comes in for the first time that greek spondai otaes that high seriousness which is one of tennyson's chief characteristics we see it in the palace of art in none and in the verses to </s>
<s> but in intrinsic merit the poems were no advance on their predecessors for the execution was not equal to the design </s>
<s> the best such as none dream of fair women the palace of art the lady of shalott am speaking of course of these poems in their first form were full of extraordinary blemishes </s>
<s> the volume was degraded by pieces which were very unworthy of him such as darling room and the verses to christopher north and affectations of the worst kind deformed many nay perhaps the majority of the poems </s>
<s> but the capital defect lay in the workmanship </s>
<s> the diction is often languid and slipshod sometimes quaintly affected and we can never go far without encountering lines stanzas whole poems which cry aloud for the file </s>
<s> the power and charm of tennyson's poetry even at its ripest depend very largely often mainly on expression and the couplet which he envied browning the little more and how much it is the little less and what worlds away is strangely applicable to his own art </s>
<s> on single word on subtle collocation on slight touch depend often his finest effects the little less reduces him to mediocrity the little more and he is with the masters </s>
<s> to no poetry would the application of goethe's test be as rule more fatal that the real poetic quality in poetry is that which remains when it has been translated literally into prose </s>
<s> whoever will compare the poems of with the same poems as they appeared in will see that the difference is not so much difference in degree but almost difference in kind </s>
<s> in the collection of there were three gems the sisters the lines to </s>
<s> and the may queen </s>
<s> almost all the others which are of any value were in the edition of carefully revised and in some cases practically rewritten </s>
<s> if tennyson's career had closed in he would hardly have won prominent place among the minor poets of the present century </s>
<s> the nine years which intervened between the publication of his second volume and the volumes of were the making of him and transformed mere dilettante into master </s>
<s> much has been said about the brutality of lockhart's review in the quarterly </s>
<s> in some respects it was stupid in some respects it was unjust but of one thing there can be no doubt it had most salutary effect </s>
<s> it held up the mirror to weaknesses and deficiencies which if tennyson did not care to acknowledge to others he must certainly have acknowledged to himself </s>
<s> it roused him and put him on his mettle </s>
<s> it was wholesome antidote to the enervating flattery of coteries and apostles who were certainly talking great deal of nonsense about him as arthur hallam's essay in the englishman shows </s>
<s> during the next nine years he published nothing with the exception of two unimportant contributions to certain minor periodicals but he was educating himself saturating himself with all that is best in the poetry of ancient greece and rome of modern italy of germany and of his own country studying theology metaphysics natural history geology astronomy and travels observing nature with the eye of poet painter and naturalist </s>
<s> nor was he recluse </s>
<s> he threw himself heartily into the life of his time following with the keenest interest all the great political and social movements the progress and effects of the reform bill the troubles in ireland the troubles with the colonies the struggles between the protectionists and the free traders municipal reform the advance of the democracy chartism the popular education question </s>
<s> he travelled on the continent he travelled in wales and scotland he visited most parts of england not as an idle tourist but as student with note book in hand </s>
<s> and he had been submitted also to the discipline which is of all disciplines the most necessary to the poet and without which as goethe says he knows not the heavenly powers he had ate his bread in sorrow </s>
<s> the death of his father in had already brought him face to face as he has himself expressed it with the most solemn of all mysteries </s>
<s> in he had an awful shock in the sudden death of his friend arthur hallam an overwhelming sorrow which blotted out all joy from his life and made him long for death </s>
<s> he had other minor troubles which contributed greatly to depress him the breaking up of the old home at somersby his own poverty and uncertain prospects his being compelled in consequence to break off all intercourse with miss emily selwood </s>
<s> it is possible that love and duty may have reference to this sorrow it is certain that the two voices is autobiographical </s>
<s> such was his education between and and such the influences which were moulding him while he was slowly evolving in memoriam and the poems first published in the latter year </s>
<s> to the revision of the old poems he brought tastes and instincts cultivated by the critical study of all that was best in the poetry of the world and more particularly by familiarity singularly intimate and affectionate with the masterpieces of the ancient classics he brought also the skill of practised workman for his diligence in production was literally that of sir joshua reynolds in the sister art nulla dies sine line </s>
<s> into the composition of the new poems all this entered </s>
<s> he was no longer trifler and hedonist </s>
<s> as spedding has said his former poems betrayed an over indulgence in the luxuries of the senses profusion of splendours harmonies perfumes gorgeous apparel luscious meals and drinks and creature comforts which rather pall upon the sense and make the glories of the outward world to obscure little the world within </s>
<s> like his own lady of shalott he had communed too much with shadows </s>
<s> but the serious poet now speaks </s>
<s> he appeals less to the ear and the eye and more to the heart </s>
<s> the sensuous is subordinated to the spiritual and the moral </s>
<s> he deals immediately with the dearest concerns of man and of society </s>
<s> he has ceased to trifle </s>
<s> the the greek spondai otaes the high seriousness of the true poet occasional before now pervades and enters essentially into his work </s>
<s> it is interesting to note how many of these poems have direct didactic purpose </s>
<s> how solemn is the message delivered in such poems as the palace of art and the vision of sin how noble the teaching in love and duty in oenone in godiva in ulysses to how many must such poem as the two voices have brought solace and light how full of salutary lessons are the political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and love thou thy land and how noble is their expression </s>
<s> and even where the poems are less directly didactic it is such refreshment as busy life needs to converse with them so pure so wholesome so graciously human is their tone so tranquilly beautiful is their world </s>
<s> who could lay down the miller's daughter dora the golden year the gardener's daughter the talking oak audley court the day dream without something of the feeling which goethe felt when he first laid down the vicar of wakefield in the best lyrics in these volumes such as break break and move eastward happy earth the most fastidious of critics must recognise flawless gems </s>
<s> in the two volumes of tennyson carried to perfection all that was best in his earlier poems and displayed powers of which he may have given some indication in his cruder efforts but which must certainly have exceeded the expectation of the most sanguine of his rational admirers </s>
<s> these volumes justly gave him the first place among the poets of his time and that supremacy he maintained in the opinion of most till the day of his death </s>
<s> it would be absurd to contend that tennyson's subsequent publications added nothing to the fame which will be secured to him by these poems </s>
<s> but this at least is certain that taken with in memorium they represent the crown and flower of his achievement </s>
<s> what is best in them he never excelled and perhaps never equalled </s>
<s> we should be the poorer and much the poorer for the loss of anything which he produced subsequently it is true but would we exchange half dozen of the best of these poems or score of the best sections of in memoriam for all that he produced between and his death </s>

<s> his diction blends the two extremes of simplicity and artificiality but with such fine tact that this strange combination has seldom the effect of incongruity </s>
<s> longinus has remarked that as the fainter lustre of the stars is put out of sight by the all encompassing rays of the sun so when sublimity sheds its light round the sophistries of rhetoric they become invisible what longinus says of sublimity is equally true of sincerity and truthfulness in combination with exquisitely harmonious expression </s>
<s> we have an illustration in gray's elegy </s>
<s> nothing could be more artificial than the style but what poem in the world appeals more directly to the heart and to the eye </s>
<s> it is one thing to call art to the assistance of art it is quite another thing to call art to the assistance of nature </s>
<s> and this is what both gray and tennyson do and this is why their artificiality so far from shocking us passes in music out of sight </s>
<s> but this cannot be said of tennyson without reserve </s>
<s> at times his strained endeavours to give distinction to his style by putting common things in an uncommon way led him into intolerable affectation </s>
<s> thus we have the knightly growth that fringed his lips for moustache azure pillars of the hearth for ascending smoke ambrosial orbs for apples frayed magnificence for shabby dress the secular abyss to come for future ages the sinless years that breathed beneath the syrian blue for the life of christ up went the hush'd amaze of hand and eye for gesture of surprise and the like </s>
<s> one of the worst instances is in in memoriam where what is appropriate to the simple sentiment finds as it should do corresponding simplicity of expression in the first couplet to collapse into the falsetto of strained artificiality in the second to rest beneath the clover sod that takes the sunshine and the rains or where the kneeling hamlet drains the chalice of the grapes of god </s>
<s> an illustration of the same thing almost as offensive is in enoch arden where in an otherwise studiously simple diction enoch's wares as fisherman become enoch's ocean spoil in ocean smelling osier </s>
<s> but these peculiarities are less common in the earlier poems than in the later it was vicious habit which grew on him </s>
<s> but if exception may sometimes be taken to his diction no exception can be taken to his rhythm </s>
<s> no english poet since milton tennyson's only superior in this respect had finer ear or more consummate mastery over all the resources of rhythmical expression </s>

<s> the line in the morte d'arthur this way and that dividing the swift mind is an almost literal translation of virgil's aen iv atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc and this way and that he divides his swift mind </s>
<s> another way in which they affect him is where without direct imitation they colour passages and poems as in oenone the lotos eaters tithonus tiresias the death of oenone demeter and persephone the passage beginning from the woods in the gardener's daughter which is parody of theocritus id vii seq while the cyclops invocation to galatea in theocritus id xi was plainly the model for the idyll come down maid in the seventh section of the princess just as the tournament in the same poem recalls closely the epic of homer and virgil </s>
<s> tennyson had wonderful way of transfusing as it were the essence of some beautiful passage in greek or roman poet into english </s>
<s> striking illustration of this would be the influence of reminiscences of virgil's fourth aeneid on the idyll of elaine and guinevere </s>
<s> compare for instance the following he is describing the love wasted elaine as she sits brooding in the lonely evening with the shadow of the wished for death falling on her but when they left her to herself again death like friend's voice from distant field approaching through the darkness call'd the owls wailing had power upon her and she mix'd her fancies with the sallow rifted glooms of evening and the moanings of the wind </s>
<s> how exactly does this recall in manner to be felt rather than exactly defined passage equally exquisite and equally pathetic in virgil's picture of dido where with the shadow of her death also falling upon her she seems to hear the phantom voice of her dead husband and mixes her fancies with the glooms of night and the owl's funereal wail hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis visa viri nox quum terras obscura teneret solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo pe queri et longas in fletum ducere voces </s>
<s> aen iv </s>
<s> from it she thought she clearly heard voice even the accents of her husband calling her when night was wrapping the earth with darkness and on the roof the lonely owl in funereal strains kept oft complaining drawing out into wail its protracted notes similar passages though not so striking would be the picture of pindar's elysium in tiresias the sentiment pervading the lotos eaters transferred so faithfully from the greek poets the scenery in none so crowded with details from homer theocritus and callimachus </s>
<s> sometimes we find similes suggested by the classical poets but enriched by touches from original observation as here in the princess as one that climbs peak to gaze o'er land and main and sees great black cloud drag inward from the deeps wall of night blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore </s>

<s> the simile in the first section of the princess as when field of corn bows all its ears before the roaring east reminds us of homer's greek hos ote kinaesae zephyros bathulae on elthon labros epaigixon epi aemuei astachuessin as when the west wind tosses deep cornfield rushing down with furious blast and it bows with all its ears nothing could be more happy than such an adaptation as the following ever fail'd to draw the quiet night into her blood from virgil aen iv neque unquam solvitur in somnos oculisve aut pectore noctem accipit </s>

<s> it need hardly be said that these particular passages and possibly some of the others may be mere coincidences but they illustrate what numberless other passages which could be cited prove that tennyson's careful and meditative study of the greek and roman poets enabled him to enrich his work by these felicitous adaptations </s>

<s> the originator of this species of poetry in england was southey in his english eclogues written before </s>
<s> in the preface to these eclogues which are in blank verse southey says the following eclogues believe bear no resemblance to any poems in our language </s>
<s> this species of composition has become popular in germany and was induced to attempt it by an account of the german idylls given me in conversation southey's eclogues are eight in number the old mansion house the grandmother's tale hannah the sailor's mother the witch the ruined cottage the last of the family and the alderman's funeral </s>
<s> southey was followed by wordsworth in the brothers and michael </s>
<s> southey has nothing of the charm grace and classical finish of his disciple but how nearly tennyson follows him as copy and model may be seen by anyone who compares tennyson's studies with the ruined cottage </s>
<s> but tennyson's real master was theocritus whose influence pervades these poems not so much directly in definite imitation as indirectly in colour and tone </s>
<s> the gardener's daughter was written as early as as it was read to fitzgerald in that year life of tennyson </s>
<s> tennyson originally intended to insert prologue to be entitled the antechamber which contained an elaborate picture of himself but he afterwards suppressed it </s>

<s> and up we rose and on the spur we went </s>
<s> not wholly in the busy world nor quite beyond it blooms the garden that love </s>
<s> news from the humming city comes to it in sound of funeral or of marriage bells and sitting muffled in dark leaves you hear the windy clanging of the minster clock although between it and the garden lies league of grass wash'd by slow broad stream that stirr'd with languid pulses of the oar waves all its lazy lilies and creeps on barge laden to three arches of bridge crown'd with the minster towers </s>
<s> the fields between are dewy fresh browsed by deep udder'd kine and all about the large lime feathers low the lime summer home of murmurous wings </s>

<s> the common mouth so gross to express delight in praise of her grew oratory </s>
<s> such lord is love and beauty such mistress of the world </s>
<s> and if said that fancy led by love would play with flying forms and images yet this is also true that long before look'd upon her when heard her name my heart was like prophet to my heart and told me should love </s>
<s> crowd of hopes that sought to sow themselves like winged seeds born out of everything heard and saw flutter'd about my senses and my soul and vague desires like fitful blasts of balm to one that travels quickly made the air of life delicious and all kinds of thought that verged upon them sweeter than the dream dream'd by happy man when the dark east unseen is brightening to his bridal morn </s>
<s> and sure this orbit of the memory folds for ever in itself the day we went to see her </s>
<s> all the land in flowery squares beneath broad and equal blowing wind smelt of the coming summer as one large cloud drew downward but all else of heaven was pure up to the sun and may from verge to verge and may with me from head to heel </s>
<s> and now as tho twere yesterday as tho it were the hour just flown that morn with all its sound for those old mays had thrice the life of these rings in mine ears </s>
<s> the steer forgot to graze and where the hedge row cuts the pathway stood leaning his horns into the neighbour field and lowing to his fellows </s>
<s> from the woods came voices of the well contented doves </s>
<s> the lark could scarce get out his notes for joy but shook his song together as he near'd his happy home the ground </s>
<s> to left and right the cuckoo told his name to all the hills the mellow ouzel fluted in the elm the redcap whistled and the nightingale sang loud as tho he were the bird of day </s>
<s> and eustace turn'd and smiling said to me hear how the bushes echo </s>
<s> by my life these birds have joyful thoughts </s>
<s> think you they sing like poets from the vanity of song </s>

<s> lightly he laugh'd as one that read my thought and on we went but ere an hour had pass'd we reach'd meadow slanting to the north down which well worn pathway courted us to one green wicket in privet hedge this yielding gave into grassy walk thro crowded lilac ambush trimly pruned and one warm gust full fed with perfume blew beyond us as we enter'd in the cool </s>

<s> for up the porch there grew an eastern rose that flowering high the last night's gale had caught and blown across the walk </s>
<s> one arm aloft gown'd in pure white that fitted to the shape holding the bush to fix it back she stood </s>
<s> single stream of all her soft brown hair pour'd on one side the shadow of the flowers stole all the golden gloss and wavering lovingly lower trembled on her waist ah happy shade and still went wavering down but ere it touch'd foot that might have danced the greensward into greener circles dipt and mix'd with shadows of the common ground </s>
<s> but the full day dwelt on her brows and sunn'd her violet eyes and all her hebe bloom and doubled his own warmth against her lips and on the bounteous wave of such breast as never pencil drew </s>
<s> half light half shade she stood sight to make an old man young </s>
<s> so rapt we near'd the house but she rose in roses mingled with her fragrant toil nor heard us come nor from her tendance turn'd into the world without till close at hand and almost ere knew mine own intent this murmur broke the stillness of that air which brooded round about her ah one rose one rose but one by those fair fingers cull'd were worth hundred kisses press'd on lips less exquisite than thine she look'd but all suffused with blushes neither self possess'd nor startled but betwixt this mood and that divided in graceful quiet paused and dropt the branch she held and turning wound her looser hair in braid and stirr'd her lips for some sweet answer tho no answer came nor yet refused the rose but granted it and moved away and left me statue like in act to render thanks </s>
