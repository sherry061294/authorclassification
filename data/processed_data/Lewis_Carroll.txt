<s> goblin lead them up and down the ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of night when two travellers might have been observed swiftly at pace of six miles in the hour descending the rugged side of mountain the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of fawn while his companion whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district toiled on painfully at his side </s>
<s> as is always the case under such circumstances the younger knight was the first to break the silence </s>
<s> goodly pace trow he exclaimed </s>
<s> we sped not thus in the ascent goodly indeed the other echoed with groan </s>
<s> we clomb it but at three miles in the hour and on the dead level our pace is the younger suggested for he was weak in statistics and left all such details to his aged companion </s>
<s> four miles in the hour the other wearily replied </s>
<s> not an ounce more he added with that love of metaphor so common in old age and not farthing less twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry the young man said musingly </s>
<s> we shall scarce be back by supper time </s>
<s> perchance mine host will roundly deny us all food he will chide our tardy return was the grave reply and such rebuke will be meet brave conceit cried the other with merry laugh </s>
<s> and should we bid him bring us yet another course trow his answer will be tart we shall but get our deserts sighed the elder knight who had never seen joke in his life and was somewhat displeased at his companion's untimely levity </s>
<s> twill be nine of the clock he added in an undertone by the time we regain our hostelry </s>
<s> full many mile shall we have plodded this day how many </s>
<s> how many cried the eager youth ever athirst for knowledge </s>
<s> the old man was silent </s>
<s> tell me he answered after moment's thought what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak </s>
<s> not exact to the minute he added hastily reading protest in the young man's face </s>
<s> an thy guess be within one poor half hour of the mark tis all ask of thy mother's son </s>
<s> then will tell thee true to the last inch how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock groan was the young man's only reply while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him </s>

<s> eligible apartments </s>
<s> straight down the crooked lane and all round the square let's ask balbus about it said hugh </s>
<s> all right said lambert </s>
<s> he can guess it said hugh </s>
<s> rather said lambert </s>
<s> no more words were needed the two brothers understood each other perfectly </s>
<s> illustration balbus was assisting his mother in law to convince the dragon balbus was waiting for them at the hotel the journey down had tired him he said so his two pupils had been the round of the place in search of lodgings without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood </s>
<s> they had named him after the hero of their latin exercise book which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile genius anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance </s>
<s> balbus has overcome all his enemies had been marked by their tutor in the margin of the book successful bravery in this way he had tried to extract moral from every anecdote about balbus sometimes one of warning as in balbus had borrowed healthy dragon against which he had written rashness in speculation sometimes of encouragement as in the words influence of sympathy in united action which stood opposite to the anecdote balbus was assisting his mother in law to convince the dragon and sometimes it dwindled down to single word such as prudence which was all he could extract from the touching record that balbus having scorched the tail of the dragon went away his pupils liked the short morals best as it left them more room for marginal illustrations and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the hero's departure </s>
<s> their report of the state of things was discouraging </s>
<s> that most fashionable of watering places little mendip was chockfull as the boys expressed it from end to end </s>
<s> but in one square they had seen no less than four cards in different houses all announcing in flaming capitals eligible apartments so there's plenty of choice after all you see said spokesman hugh in conclusion </s>
<s> that doesn't follow from the data said balbus as he rose from the easy chair where he had been dozing over the little mendip gazette </s>
<s> they may be all single rooms </s>
<s> however we may as well see them </s>
<s> shall be glad to stretch my legs bit an unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was needless and that this long lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils </s>
<s> one on each side they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides while hugh repeated the sentence in their father's letter just received from abroad over which he and lambert had been puzzling </s>
<s> he says friend of his the governor of what was that name again lambert kgovjni said lambert well yes </s>
<s> the governor of what you may call it wants to give very small dinner party and he means to ask his father's brother in law his brother's father in law his father in law's brother and his brother in law's father and we're to guess how many guests there will be there was an anxious pause </s>
<s> how large did he say the pudding was to be balbus said at last </s>
<s> take its cubical contents divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat and the quotient he didn't say anything about pudding said hugh and here's the square as they turned corner and came into sight of the eligible apartments it is square was balbus first cry of delight as he gazed around him </s>
<s> beautiful </s>
<s> beau ti ful </s>
<s> equilateral </s>
<s> and rectangular the boys looked round with less enthusiasm </s>
<s> number nine is the first with card said prosaic lambert but balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty </s>
<s> see boys he cried </s>
<s> twenty doors on side </s>
<s> what symmetry </s>
<s> each side divided into twenty one equal parts </s>
<s> it's delicious shall knock or ring said hugh looking in some perplexity at square brass plate which bore the simple inscription ring also both said balbus </s>
<s> that's an ellipsis my boy </s>
<s> did you never see an ellipsis before couldn't hardly read it said hugh evasively </s>
<s> it's no good having an ellipsis if they don't keep it clean which there is one room gentlemen said the smiling landlady </s>
<s> and sweet room too </s>
<s> as snug little back room we will see it said balbus gloomily as they followed her in </s>
<s> knew how it would be </s>
<s> one room in each house </s>
<s> no view suppose which indeed there is gentlemen the landlady indignantly protested as she drew up the blind and indicated the back garden </s>
<s> cabbages perceive said balbus </s>
<s> well they're green at any rate which the greens at the shops their hostess explained are by no means dependable upon </s>
<s> here you has them on the premises and of the best does the window open was always balbus first question in testing lodging and does the chimney smoke his second </s>
<s> satisfied on all points he secured the refusal of the room and they moved on to number twenty five </s>
<s> this landlady was grave and stern </s>
<s> i've nobbut one room left she told them and it gives on the back gyardin but there are cabbages balbus suggested </s>
<s> the landlady visibly relented </s>
<s> there is sir she said and good ones though say it as shouldn't </s>
<s> we can't rely on the shops for greens </s>
<s> so we grows them ourselves singular advantage said balbus and after the usual questions they went on to fifty two </s>
<s> and i'd gladly accommodate you all if could was the greeting that met them </s>
<s> we are but mortal irrelevant muttered balbus and i've let all my rooms but one which one is back room perceive said balbus and looking out on on cabbages presume yes indeed sir said their hostess </s>
<s> whatever other folks may do we grows our own </s>
<s> for the shops an excellent arrangement balbus interrupted </s>
<s> then one can really depend on their being good </s>
<s> does the window open the usual questions were answered satisfactorily but this time hugh added one of his own invention does the cat scratch the landlady looked round suspiciously as if to make sure the cat was not listening will not deceive you gentlemen she said </s>
<s> it do scratch but not without you pulls its whiskers </s>
<s> it'll never do it she repeated slowly with visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat without you pulls its whiskers much may be excused in cat so treated said balbus as they left the house and crossed to number seventy three leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep and still murmuring to herself her parting words as if they were form of blessing not without you pulls its whiskers at number seventy three they found only small shy girl to show the house who said yes'm in answer to all questions </s>
<s> the usual room said balbus as they marched in the usual back garden the usual cabbages </s>
<s> suppose you can't get them good at the shops yes'm said the girl </s>
<s> well you may tell your mistress we will take the room and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply admirable yes'm said the girl as she showed them out </s>
<s> one day room and three bed rooms said balbus as they returned to the hotel </s>
<s> we will take as our day room the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it must we walk from door to door and count the steps said lambert </s>
<s> no no </s>
<s> figure it out my boys figure it out balbus gaily exclaimed as he put pens ink and paper before his hapless pupils and left the room </s>

<s> mad mathesis </s>
<s> waited for the train well they call me so because am little mad suppose she said good humouredly in answer to clara's cautiously worded question as to how she came by so strange nick name </s>
<s> you see never do what sane people are expected to do now days </s>
<s> never wear long trains talking of trains that's the charing cross metropolitan station i've something to tell you about that and never play lawn tennis </s>
<s> can't cook an omelette </s>
<s> can't even set broken limb </s>
<s> there's an ignoramus for you clara was her niece and full twenty years her junior in fact she was still attending high school an institution of which mad mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion </s>
<s> let woman be meek and lowly she would say </s>
<s> none of your high schools for me but it was vacation time just now and clara was her guest and mad mathesis was showing her the sights of that eighth wonder of the world london </s>
<s> the charing cross metropolitan station she resumed waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to friend </s>
<s> the bayswater and birmingham extension is just completed and the trains now run round and round continuously skirting the border of wales just touching at york and so round by the east coast back to london </s>
<s> the way the trains run is most peculiar </s>
<s> the westerly ones go round in two hours the easterly ones take three but they always manage to start two trains from here opposite ways punctually every quarter of an hour they part to meet again said clara her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought </s>
<s> no need to cry about it her aunt grimly remarked </s>
<s> they don't meet on the same line of rails you know </s>
<s> talking of meeting an idea strikes me she added changing the subject with her usual abruptness </s>
<s> let's go opposite ways round and see which can meet most trains </s>
<s> no need for chaperon ladies saloon you know </s>
<s> you shall go whichever way you like and we'll have bet about it never make bets clara said very gravely </s>
<s> our excellent preceptress has often warned us you'd be none the worse if you did mad mathesis interrupted </s>
<s> in fact you'd be the better i'm certain neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns said clara </s>
<s> but we'll have match if you like </s>
<s> let me choose my train she added after brief mental calculation and i'll engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do not if you count fair mad mathesis bluntly interrupted </s>
<s> remember we only count the trains we meet on the way </s>
<s> you mustn't count the one that starts as you start nor the one that arrives as you arrive that will only make the difference of one train said clara as they turned and entered the station </s>
<s> but never travelled alone before </s>
<s> there'll be no one to help me to alight </s>
<s> however don't mind </s>
<s> let's have match ragged little boy overheard her remark and came running after her </s>
<s> buy box of cigar lights miss he pleaded pulling her shawl to attract her attention </s>
<s> clara stopped to explain </s>
<s> never smoke cigars she said in meekly apologetic tone </s>
<s> our excellent preceptress but mad mathesis impatiently hurried her on and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement </s>
<s> the two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform mad mathesis prattling on as usual clara silent anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match </s>
<s> mind where you go dear cried her aunt checking her just in time </s>
<s> one step more and you'd have been in that pail of cold water know know clara said dreamily </s>
<s> the pale the cold and the moony take your places on the spring boards shouted porter </s>
<s> what are they for clara asked in terrified whisper </s>
<s> merely to help us into the trains the elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process </s>
<s> very few people can get into carriage without help in less than three seconds and the trains only stop for one second at this moment the whistle was heard and two trains rushed into the station </s>
<s> moment's pause and they were gone again but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of minie bullet while an equal number were showered out upon the side platforms </s>
<s> three hours had passed away and the two friends met again on the charing cross platform and eagerly compared notes </s>
<s> then clara turned away with sigh </s>
<s> to young impulsive hearts like hers disappointment is always bitter pill </s>
<s> mad mathesis followed her full of kindly sympathy </s>
<s> try again my love she said cheerily </s>
<s> let us vary the experiment </s>
<s> we will start as we did before but not to begin counting till our trains meet </s>
<s> when we see each other we will say one and so count on till we come here again clara brightened up </s>
<s> shall win that she exclaimed eagerly if may choose my train another shriek of engine whistles another upheaving of spring boards another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by and the travellers were off again </s>
<s> each gazed eagerly from her carriage window holding up her handkerchief as signal to her friend </s>
<s> rush and roar </s>
<s> two trains shot past each other in tunnel and two travellers leaned back in their corners with sigh or rather with two sighs of relief </s>
<s> one clara murmured to herself </s>
<s> won </s>
<s> it's word of good omen </s>
<s> this time at any rate the victory will be mine but was it </s>
<s> knot iv </s>
<s> the dead reckoning </s>
<s> did dream of money bags to night noonday on the open sea within few degrees of the equator is apt to be oppressively warm and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen having laid aside the chain armour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing but necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights </s>
<s> their holiday trip was over and they were now on their way home in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring </s>
<s> along with their armour the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the twentieth century </s>
<s> stretched on pile of cushions under the shade of huge umbrella they were lazily watching some native fishermen who had come on board at the last landing place each carrying over his shoulder small but heavy sack </s>
<s> large weighing machine that had been used for cargo at the last port stood on the deck and round this the fishermen had gathered and with much unintelligible jabber seemed to be weighing their sacks </s>
<s> more like sparrows in tree than human talk isn't it the elder tourist remarked to his son who smiled feebly but would not exert himself so far as to speak </s>
<s> the old man tried another listener </s>
<s> what have they got in those sacks captain he inquired as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck </s>
<s> the captain paused in his march and towered over the travellers tall grave and serenely self satisfied </s>
<s> fishermen he explained are often passengers in my ship </s>
<s> these five are from mhruxi the place we last touched at and that's the way they carry their money </s>
<s> the money of this island is heavy gentlemen but it costs little as you may guess </s>
<s> we buy it from them by weight about five shillings pound </s>
<s> fancy ten pound note would buy all those sacks by this time the old man had closed his eyes in order no doubt to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts but the captain failed to realise his motive and with grunt resumed his monotonous march </s>
<s> meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing machine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winch handles belaying pins as they could find </s>
<s> this brought their excitement to speedy end they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists and strolled away </s>
<s> when next the captain's heavy footfall passed the younger man roused himself to speak </s>
<s> what did you call the place those fellows came from captain he asked </s>
<s> mhruxi sir and the one we are bound for the captain took long breath plunged into the word and came out of it nobly </s>
<s> they call it kgovjni sir give it up the young man faintly said </s>
<s> he stretched out his hand for glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him minute ago and had set down unluckily just outside the shadow of the umbrella </s>
<s> it was scalding hot and he decided not to drink it </s>
<s> the effort of making this resolution coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through was too much for him he sank back among the cushions in silence </s>
<s> his father courteously tried to make amends for his nonchalance </s>
<s> whereabouts are we now captain said he have you any idea the captain cast pitying look on the ignorant landsman </s>
<s> could tell you that sir he said in tone of lofty condescension to an inch you don't say so the old man remarked in tone of languid surprise </s>
<s> and mean so persisted the captain </s>
<s> why what do you suppose would become of my ship if were to lose my longitude and my latitude </s>
<s> could you make anything of my dead reckoning nobody could i'm sure the other heartily rejoined </s>
<s> but he had overdone it </s>
<s> it's perfectly intelligible the captain said in an offended tone to any one that understands such things with these words he moved away and began giving orders to the men who were preparing to hoist the jib </s>
<s> our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five money bags which in another moment as the wind filled out the jib were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea </s>
<s> but the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property </s>
<s> in moment they had rushed to the spot and stood uttering cries of fury and pointing now to the sea and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster </s>
<s> the old man explained it to the captain </s>
<s> let us make it up among us he added in conclusion </s>
<s> ten pounds will do it think you said illustration but the captain put aside the suggestion with wave of the hand </s>
<s> no sir he said in his grandest manner </s>
<s> you will excuse me am sure but these are my passengers </s>
<s> the accident has happened on board my ship and under my orders </s>
<s> it is for me to make compensation he turned to the angry fishermen </s>
<s> come here my men he said in the mhruxian dialect </s>
<s> tell me the weight of each sack </s>
<s> saw you weighing them just now then ensued perfect babel of noise as the five natives explained all screaming together how the sailors had carried off the weights and they had done what they could with whatever came handy </s>
<s> two iron belaying pins three blocks six holystones four winch handles and large hammer were now carefully weighed the captain superintending and noting the results </s>
<s> but the matter did not seem to be settled even then an angry discussion followed in which the sailors and the five natives all joined and at last the captain approached our tourists with disconcerted look which he tried to conceal under laugh </s>
<s> it's an absurd difficulty he said </s>
<s> perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something </s>
<s> it seems they weighed the sacks two at time if they didn't have five separate weighings of course you can't value them separately the youth hastily decided </s>
<s> let's hear all about it was the old man's more cautious remark </s>
<s> they did have five separate weighings the captain said but well it beats me entirely he added in sudden burst of candour </s>
<s> here's the result </s>
<s> first and second sack weighed twelve pounds second and third thirteen and half third and fourth eleven and half fourth and fifth eight and then they say they had only the large hammer left and it took three sacks to weigh it down that's the first third and fifth and they weighed sixteen pounds </s>
<s> there gentlemen </s>
<s> did you ever hear anything like that the old man muttered under his breath if only my sister were here and looked helplessly at his son </s>
<s> his son looked at the five natives </s>
<s> the five natives looked at the captain </s>
<s> the captain looked at nobody his eyes were cast down and he seemed to be saying softly to himself contemplate one another gentlemen if such be your good pleasure </s>
<s> contemplate myself knot </s>
<s> oughts and crosses </s>
<s> look here upon this picture and on this and what made you choose the first train goosey said mad mathesis as they got into the cab </s>
<s> couldn't you count better than that took an extreme case was the tearful reply </s>
<s> our excellent preceptress always says when in doubt my dears take an extreme case and was in doubt does it always succeed her aunt enquired </s>
<s> clara sighed </s>
<s> not always she reluctantly admitted </s>
<s> and can't make out why </s>
<s> one day she was telling the little girls they make such noise at tea you know the more noise you make the less jam you will have and vice vers and thought they wouldn't know what vice vers meant so explained it to them </s>
<s> said if you make an infinite noise you'll get no jam and if you make no noise you'll get an infinite lot of jam but our excellent preceptress said that wasn't good instance </s>
<s> why wasn't it she added plaintively </s>
<s> her aunt evaded the question </s>
<s> one sees certain objections to it she said </s>
<s> but how did you work it with the metropolitan trains </s>
<s> none of them go infinitely fast believe called them hares and tortoises clara said little timidly for she dreaded being laughed at </s>
<s> and thought there couldn't be so many hares as tortoises on the line so took an extreme case one hare and an infinite number of tortoises an extreme case indeed her aunt remarked with admirable gravity and most dangerous state of things and thought if went with tortoise there would be only one hare to meet but if went with the hare you know there were crowds of tortoises it wasn't bad idea said the elder lady as they left the cab at the entrance of burlington house </s>
<s> you shall have another chance to day </s>
<s> we'll have match in marking pictures clara brightened up </s>
<s> should like to try again very much she said </s>
<s> i'll take more care this time </s>
<s> how are we to play to this question mad mathesis made no reply she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue </s>
<s> see she said after minute i've drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room and want you to fill them with oughts and crosses crosses for good marks and oughts for bad </s>
<s> the first column is for choice of subject the second for arrangement the third for colouring </s>
<s> and these are the conditions of the match </s>
<s> you must give three crosses to two or three pictures </s>
<s> you must give two crosses to four or five do you mean only two crosses said clara </s>
<s> or may count the three cross pictures among the two cross pictures of course you may said her aunt </s>
<s> any one that has three eyes may be said to have two eyes suppose clara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery half dreading to find that there was three eyed person in sight </s>
<s> and you must give one cross to nine or ten and which wins the match clara asked as she carefully entered these conditions on blank leaf in her catalogue </s>
<s> whichever marks fewest pictures but suppose we marked the same number then whichever uses most marks clara considered </s>
<s> don't think it's much of match she said </s>
<s> shall mark nine pictures and give three crosses to three of them two crosses to two more and one cross each to all the rest will you indeed said her aunt </s>
<s> wait till you've heard all the conditions my impetuous child </s>
<s> you must give three oughts to one or two pictures two oughts to three or four and one ought to eight or nine </s>
<s> don't want you to be too hard on the clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions </s>
<s> it's great deal worse than circulating decimals she said </s>
<s> but i'm determined to win all the same her aunt smiled grimly </s>
<s> we can begin here she said as they paused before gigantic picture which the catalogue informed them was the portrait of lieutenant brown mounted on his favorite elephant he looks awfully conceited said clara </s>
<s> don't think he was the elephant's favorite lieutenant </s>
<s> what hideous picture it is </s>
<s> and it takes up room enough for twenty mind what you say my dear her aunt interposed </s>
<s> it's by an but clara was quite reckless </s>
<s> don't care who it's by she cried </s>
<s> and shall give it three bad marks aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd and for the next half hour clara was hard at work putting in marks and rubbing them out again and hunting up and down for suitable pictures </s>
<s> this she found the hardest part of all </s>
<s> can't find the one want she exclaimed at last almost crying with vexation </s>
<s> what is it you want to find my dear the voice was strange to clara but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it even before she had seen her and when she turned and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies whose round dimpled faces exactly alike seemed never to have known care it was as much as she could do as she confessed to aunt mattie afterwards to keep herself from hugging them both </s>
<s> was looking for picture she said that has good subject and that's well arranged but badly coloured the little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm </s>
<s> calm yourself my dear said the one who had spoken first and try to remember which it was </s>
<s> what was the subject was it an elephant for instance the other sister suggested </s>
<s> they were still in sight of lieutenant brown </s>
<s> don't know indeed clara impetuously replied </s>
<s> you know it doesn't matter bit what the subject is so long as it's good one once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm and one of them whispered something to the other of which clara caught only the one word mad they mean aunt mattie of course she said to herself fancying in her innocence that london was like her native town where everybody knew everybody else </s>
<s> if you mean my aunt she added aloud she's there just three pictures beyond lieutenant brown ah well </s>
<s> then you'd better go to her my dear her new friend said soothingly </s>
<s> she'll find you the picture you want </s>
<s> good bye dear good bye dear echoed the other sister mind you don't lose sight of your aunt and the pair trotted off into another room leaving clara rather perplexed at their manner </s>
<s> they're real darlings she soliloquised </s>
<s> wonder why they pity me so and she wandered on murmuring to herself it must have two good marks and knot vi </s>
<s> her radiancy </s>
<s> one piecee thing that my have got maskee that thing my no can do </s>
<s> you talkee you no sabey what </s>
<s> bamboo they landed and were at once conducted to the palace </s>
<s> about half way they were met by the governor who welcomed them in english great relief to our travellers whose guide could speak nothing but kgovjnian </s>
<s> don't half like the way they grin at us as we go by the old man whispered to his son </s>
<s> and why do they say bamboo so often it alludes to local custom replied the governor who had overheard the question </s>
<s> such persons as happen in any way to displease her radiancy are usually beaten with rods illustration why do they say bamboo so often the old man shuddered </s>
<s> most objectional local custom he remarked with strong emphasis </s>
<s> wish we had never landed </s>
<s> did you notice that black fellow norman opening his great mouth at us </s>
<s> verily believe he would like to eat us norman appealed to the governor who was walking at his other side </s>
<s> do they often eat distinguished strangers here he said in as indifferent tone as he could assume </s>
<s> not often not ever was the welcome reply </s>
<s> they are not good for it </s>
<s> pigs we eat for they are fat </s>
<s> this old man is thin and thankful to be so muttered the elder traveller </s>
<s> beaten we shall be without doubt </s>
<s> it's comfort to know it won't be beaten without the </s>
<s> my dear boy just look at the peacocks they were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds each held in check by means of golden collar and chain by black slave who stood well behind so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes </s>
<s> the governor smiled proudly </s>
<s> in your honour he said her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks </s>
<s> she will no doubt decorate you before you go with the usual star and feathers it'll be star without the faltered one of his hearers </s>
<s> come come </s>
<s> don't lose heart said the other </s>
<s> all this is full of charm for me you are young norman sighed his father young and light hearted </s>
<s> for me it is charm without the the old one is sad the governor remarked with some anxiety </s>
<s> he has without doubt effected some fearful crime but haven't the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed </s>
<s> tell him haven't norman he has not as yet norman gently explained </s>
<s> and the governor repeated in satisfied tone not as yet yours is wondrous country the governor resumed after pause </s>
<s> now here is letter from friend of mine merchant in london </s>
<s> he and his brother went there year ago with thousand pounds apiece and on new year's day they had sixty thousand pounds between them how did they do it norman eagerly exclaimed </s>
<s> even the elder traveller looked excited </s>
<s> the governor handed him the open letter </s>
<s> anybody can do it when once they know how so ran this oracular document </s>
<s> we borrowed nought we stole nought </s>
<s> we began the year with only thousand pounds apiece and last new year's day we had sixty thousand pounds between us sixty thousand golden sovereigns norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter </s>
<s> his father hazarded one guess </s>
<s> was it by gambling kgovjnian never gambles said the governor gravely as he ushered them through the palace gates </s>
<s> they followed him in silence down long passage and soon found themselves in lofty hall lined entirely with peacocks feathers </s>
<s> in the centre was pile of crimson cushions which almost concealed the figure of her radiancy plump little damsel in robe of green satin dotted with silver stars whose pale round face lit up for moment with half smile as the travellers bowed before her and then relapsed into the exact expression of wax doll while she languidly murmured word or two in the kgovjnian dialect </s>

<s> let's get you helped first said balbus briskly cutting away at the joint </s>
<s> you know the old proverb mutton first mechanics afterwards the boys did not know the proverb but they accepted it in perfect good faith as they did every piece of information however startling that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor </s>
<s> they ate on steadily in silence and when dinner was over hugh set out the usual array of pens ink and paper while balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoon's task </s>
<s> friend of mine has flower garden very pretty one though no great size how big is it said hugh </s>
<s> that's what you have to find out balbus gaily replied </s>
<s> all tell you is that it is oblong in shape just half yard longer than its width and that gravel walk one yard wide begins at one corner and runs all round it joining into itself said hugh </s>
<s> not joining into itself young man </s>
<s> just before doing that it turns corner and runs round the garden again alongside of the first portion and then inside that again winding in and in and each lap touching the last one till it has used up the whole of the area like serpent with corners said lambert </s>
<s> exactly so </s>
<s> and if you walk the whole length of it to the last inch keeping in the centre of the path it's exactly two miles and half furlong </s>
<s> now while you find out the length and breadth of the garden i'll see if can think out that sea water puzzle you said it was flower garden hugh inquired as balbus was leaving the room </s>
<s> did said balbus </s>
<s> where do the flowers grow said hugh </s>
<s> but balbus thought it best not to hear the question </s>
<s> he left the boys to their problem and in the silence of his own room set himself to unravel hugh's mechanical paradox </s>
<s> to fix our thoughts he murmured to himself as with hands deep buried in his pockets he paced up and down the room we will take cylindrical glass jar with scale of inches marked up the side and fill it with water up to the inch mark and we will assume that every inch depth of jar contains pint of water </s>
<s> we will now take solid cylinder such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half pint of water and plunge inches of it into the water so that the end of the cylinder comes down to the inch mark </s>
<s> well that displaces pints of water </s>
<s> what becomes of them </s>
<s> why if there were no more cylinder they would lie comfortably on the top and fill the jar up to the inch mark </s>
<s> but unfortunately there is more cylinder occupying half the space between the inch and the inch marks so that only one pint of water can be accommodated there </s>
<s> what becomes of the other pint </s>
<s> why if there were no more cylinder it would lie on the top and fill the jar up to the inch mark </s>
<s> but unfortunately shade of newton he exclaimed in sudden accents of terror </s>
<s> when does the water stop rising bright idea struck him </s>
<s> i'll write little essay on it he said </s>
<s> balbus's essay when solid is immersed in liquid it is well known that it displaces portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if quantity of liquid had been added to it equal in bulk to the solid </s>
<s> lardner says precisely the same process occurs when solid is partially immersed the quantity of liquid displaced in this case equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed and the rise of the level being in proportion </s>
<s> suppose solid held above the surface of liquid and partially immersed portion of the liquid is displaced and the level of the liquid rises </s>
<s> but by this rise of level little bit more of the solid is of course immersed and so there is new displacement of second portion of the liquid and consequent rise of level </s>
<s> again this second rise of level causes yet further immersion and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise </s>
<s> it is self evident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid which being connected with it must for the time be considered part of it </s>
<s> if you hold stick six feet long with its end in tumbler of water and wait long enough you must eventually be immersed </s>
<s> the question as to the source from which the water is supplied which belongs to high branch of mathematics and is therefore beyond our present scope does not apply to the sea </s>
<s> let us therefore take the familiar instance of man standing at the edge of the sea at ebb tide with solid in his hand which he partially immerses he remains steadfast and unmoved and we all know that he must be drowned </s>
<s> the multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest philosophical truth and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores have truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than galileo or kepler </s>
<s> to use kossuth's eloquent phrase they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth century there's fallacy somewhere he murmured drowsily as he stretched his long legs upon the sofa </s>
<s> must think it over again he closed his eyes in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly and for the next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view of the subject </s>

<s> sometimes balbus gently insisted </s>
<s> six midnights out of seven it changes to some other name meant of course hugh corrected himself when it does change from wednesday to thursday it does it at midnight and only at midnight surely said balbus </s>

<s> even lambert nodded this time </s>
<s> but it isn't midnight anywhere else so it can't be changing from one day to another anywhere else </s>
<s> and yet if ireland and america and so on call it wednesday and germany and russia and so on call it thursday there must be some place not chelsea that has different days on the two sides of it </s>
<s> and the worst of it is the people there get their days in the wrong order they've got wednesday east of them and thursday west just as if their day had changed from thursday to wednesday i've heard that puzzle before cried lambert </s>
<s> and i'll tell you the explanation </s>
<s> when ship goes round the world from east to west we know that it loses day in its reckoning so that when it gets home and calls its day wednesday it finds people here calling it thursday because we've had one more midnight than the ship has had </s>
<s> and when you go the other way round you gain day know all that said hugh in reply to this not very lucid explanation but it doesn't help me because the ship hasn't proper days </s>
<s> one way round you get more than twenty four hours to the day and the other way you get less so of course the names get wrong but people that live on in one place always get twenty four hours to the day suppose there is such place balbus said meditatively though never heard of it </s>
<s> and the people must find it very queer as hugh says to have the old day east of them and the new one west because when midnight comes round to them with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it one doesn't see exactly what happens </s>

<s> trojanus however says assuming in default of any information that the street enters the square in the middle of each side it may be supposed that the numbering begins at street but surely the other is the more natural assumption </s>
<s> in knot vi the first problem was of course mere jeu de mots whose presence thought excusable in series of problems whose aim is to entertain rather than to instruct but it has not escaped the contemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents who seem to think that apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch </s>
<s> neither of them has guessed it and this is true human nature </s>
<s> only the other day the st of september to be quite exact met my old friend brown and gave him riddle had just heard </s>
<s> with one great effort of his colossal mind brown guessed it </s>
<s> right said </s>
<s> ah said he it's very neat very neat </s>
<s> and it isn't an answer that would occur to everybody </s>
<s> very neat indeed few yards further on fell in with smith and to him propounded the same riddle </s>
<s> he frowned over it for minute and then gave it up </s>
<s> meekly faltered out the answer </s>
<s> poor thing sir smith growled as he turned away </s>
<s> very poor thing </s>
<s> wonder you care to repeat such rubbish yet smith's mind is if possible even more colossal than brown's </s>
<s> the second problem of knot vi </s>
<s> is an example in ordinary double rule of three whose essential feature is that the result depends on the variation of several elements which are so related to it that if all but one be constant it varies as that one hence if none be constant it varies as their product </s>
<s> thus for example the cubical contents of rectangular tank vary as its length if breadth and depth be constant and so on hence if none be constant it varies as the product of the length breadth and depth </s>
<s> when the result is not thus connected with the varying elements the problem ceases to be double rule of three and often becomes one of great complexity </s>
<s> to illustrate this let us take two candidates for prize and who are to compete in french german and italian let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their relative knowledge of each subject so that whether their marks for french be or the result will be the same and let it also be laid down that if they get equal marks on papers the final marks are to have the same ratio as those of the rd paper </s>
<s> this is case of ordinary double rule of three </s>
<s> we multiply marks together and do the same for </s>
<s> note that if gets single his final mark is even if he gets full marks for papers while gets only one mark for each paper </s>
<s> this of course would be very unfair on though correct solution under the given conditions </s>
<s> the result is to depend as before on relative knowledge but french is to have twice as much weight as german or italian </s>
<s> this is an unusual form of question </s>
<s> should be inclined to say the resulting ratio is to be nearer to the french ratio than if we multiplied as in and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other multipliers twice to produce the same result as in if the french ratio were and the others so that the ultimate ratio by method would be should multiply instead by giving the result which is nearer to than if he had used method </s>
<s> the result is to depend on actual amount of knowledge of the subjects collectively </s>
<s> here we have to ask two questions </s>
<s> what is to be the unit standard to measure by in each subject </s>
<s> are these units to be of equal or unequal value </s>
<s> the usual unit is the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly calling this all lower amounts are represented by numbers between and then if these units are to be of equal value we simply add marks together and do the same for </s>
<s> the conditions are the same as but french is to have double weight </s>
<s> here we simply double the french marks and add as before </s>
<s> french is to have such weight that if other marks be equal the ultimate ratio is to be that of the french paper so that in this would swamp the candidate but the other two subjects are only to affect the result collectively by the amount of knowledge shown the two being reckoned of equal value </s>
<s> here should add german and italian marks together and multiply by his french mark </s>
<s> but need not go on the problem may evidently be set with many varying conditions each requiring its own method of solution </s>
<s> the problem in knot vi </s>

<s> down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of book thought alice without pictures or conversation so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her </s>
<s> there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear </s>
<s> oh dear </s>
<s> shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen rabbit with either waistcoat pocket or watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down large rabbit hole under the hedge </s>
<s> in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again </s>
<s> the rabbit hole went straight on like tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down very deep well </s>
<s> either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next </s>
<s> first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs </s>
<s> she took down jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it </s>
<s> well thought alice to herself after such fall as this shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs </s>
<s> how brave they'll all think me at home </s>
<s> why wouldn't say anything about it even if fell off the top of the house which was very likely true down down down </s>
<s> would the fall never come to an end </s>
<s> wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time she said aloud </s>
<s> must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth </s>
<s> let me see that would be four thousand miles down think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that's about the right distance but then wonder what latitude or longitude i've got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say presently she began again </s>
<s> wonder if shall fall right through the earth </s>
<s> how funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward </s>
<s> the antipathies think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn't sound at all the right word but shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know </s>
<s> please ma'am is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air </s>
<s> do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking </s>
<s> no it'll never do to ask perhaps shall see it written up somewhere down down down </s>
<s> there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again </s>
<s> dinah'll miss me very much to night should think dinah was the cat hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea time </s>
<s> dinah my dear </s>
<s> wish you were down here with me </s>
<s> there are no mice in the air i'm afraid but you might catch bat and that's very like mouse you know </s>
<s> but do cats eat bats wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats </s>
<s> do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldn't answer either question it didn't much matter which way she put it </s>
<s> she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat bat when suddenly thump </s>
<s> thump </s>
<s> down she came upon heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over </s>
<s> alice was not bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it </s>
<s> there was not moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it's getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in long low hall which was lit up by row of lamps hanging from the roof </s>
<s> there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again </s>
<s> suddenly she came upon little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except tiny golden key and alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas </s>
<s> either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them </s>
<s> however on the second time round she came upon low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted </s>
<s> alice opened the door and found that it led into small passage not much larger than rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw </s>
<s> how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders </s>
<s> oh how wish could shut up like telescope </s>
<s> think could if only know how to begin for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible </s>
<s> there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters </s>
<s> it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in hurry </s>
<s> no i'll look first she said and see whether it's marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later </s>
<s> however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off </s>
<s> what curious feeling said alice must be shutting up like telescope and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden </s>
<s> first however she waited for few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like candle </s>
<s> wonder what should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such thing </s>
<s> after while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice </s>
<s> when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried </s>
<s> come there's no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people </s>
<s> but it's no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people </s>
<s> why there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eye fell on little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants </s>
<s> well i'll eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller can creep under the door so either way i'll get into the garden and don't care which happens she ate little bit and said anxiously to herself which way </s>
<s> which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way </s>

<s> oh dear what nonsense i'm talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door </s>
<s> poor alice </s>
<s> it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again </s>
<s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way </s>
<s> stop this moment tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall </s>
<s> after time she heard little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming </s>

<s> won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go </s>
<s> alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear </s>

<s> how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws i'm sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on must be mabel after all and shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh </s>

<s> that was narrow escape said alice good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas </s>

<s> that will be queer thing to be sure </s>
<s> however everything is queer to day just then she heard something splashing about in the pool little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only mouse that had slipped in like herself </s>

<s> very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here </s>
<s> run home this moment and fetch me pair of gloves and fan </s>
<s> quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made </s>
<s> he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran </s>

<s> but i'd better take him his fan and gloves that is if can find them as she said this she came upon neat little house on the door of which was bright brass plate with the name </s>

<s> but i've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out only don't think alice went on that they'd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that by this time she had found her way into tidy little room with table in the window and on it as she had hoped fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon little bottle that stood near the looking glass </s>
<s> there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips </s>
<s> know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever eat or drink anything so i'll just see what this bottle does </s>
<s> do hope it'll make me grow large again for really i'm quite tired of being such tiny little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken </s>
<s> she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself that's quite enough hope shan't grow any more as it is can't get out at the door do wish hadn't drunk quite so much alas </s>
<s> it was too late to wish that </s>
<s> she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head </s>
<s> still she went on growing and as last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now can do no more whatever happens </s>
<s> what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy </s>
<s> it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits </s>
<s> almost wish hadn't gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet it's rather curious you know this sort of life </s>
<s> do wonder what can have happened to me </s>
<s> when used to read fairy tales fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here am in the middle of one </s>
<s> there ought to be book written about me that there ought </s>
<s> and when grow up i'll write one but i'm grown up now she added in sorrowful tone at least there's no room to grow up any more here but then thought alice shall never get any older than am now </s>
<s> that'll be comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn </s>
<s> oh shouldn't like that oh you foolish alice she answered herself </s>
<s> how can you learn lessons in here </s>
<s> why there's hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson books and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite conversation of it altogether but after few minutes she heard voice outside and stopped to listen </s>
<s> mary ann </s>
<s> mary ann said the voice </s>
<s> fetch me my gloves this moment then came little pattering of feet on the stairs </s>
<s> alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it </s>
<s> presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alice's elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved failure </s>
<s> alice heard it say to itself then i'll go round and get in at the window that you won't thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made snatch in the air </s>
<s> she did not get hold of anything but she heard little shriek and fall and crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into cucumber frame or something of the sort </s>
<s> next came an angry voice the rabbit's pat </s>
<s> pat </s>
<s> where are you and then voice she had never heard before sure then i'm here </s>
<s> digging for apples yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily </s>
<s> here </s>
<s> come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass now tell me pat what's that in the window sure it's an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum an arm you goose </s>
<s> who ever saw one that size </s>
<s> why it fills the whole window sure it does yer honour but it's an arm for all that well it's got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure don't like it yer honour at all at all do as tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air </s>
<s> this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass </s>
<s> what number of cucumber frames there must be thought alice </s>
<s> wonder what they'll do next </s>
<s> as for pulling me out of the window only wish they could </s>
<s> i'm sure don't want to stay in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of good many voices all talking together she made out the words where's the other ladder why hadn't to bring but one bill's got the other bill </s>
<s> fetch it here lad here put em up at this corner no tie em together first they don't reach half high enough yet oh </s>

<s> the master says you're to go down the chimney oh </s>
<s> so bill's got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself </s>
<s> shy they seem to put everything upon bill </s>
<s> wouldn't be in bill's place for good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but think can kick little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard little animal she couldn't guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next </s>
<s> the first thing she heard was general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit's voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now don't choke him how was it old fellow </s>
<s> what happened to you </s>
<s> tell us all about it last came little feeble squeaking voice that's bill thought alice well hardly know no more thank ye i'm better now but i'm deal too flustered to tell you all know is something comes at me like jack in the box and up goes like sky rocket so you did old fellow said the others </s>
<s> we must burn the house down said the rabbit's voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do </s>
<s> i'll set dinah at you there was dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself wonder what they will do next </s>
<s> if they had any sense they'd take the roof off after minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say barrowful will do to begin with barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face </s>
<s> i'll put stop to this she said to herself and shouted out you'd better not do that again which produced another dead silence </s>
<s> alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and bright idea came into her head </s>
<s> if eat one of these cakes she thought it's sure to make some change in my size and as it can't possibly make me larger it must make me smaller suppose so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly </s>
<s> as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside </s>
<s> the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of bottle </s>
<s> they all made rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in thick wood </s>
<s> the first thing i've got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden </s>
<s> think that will be the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in great hurry </s>
<s> an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her </s>
<s> poor little thing said alice in coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing </s>
<s> hardly knowing what she did she picked up little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having game of play with cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began series of short charges at the stick running very little way forwards each time and long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut </s>
<s> this seemed to alice good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance </s>
<s> and yet what dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if i'd only been the right size to do it </s>
<s> oh dear </s>
<s> i'd nearly forgotten that i've got to grow up again </s>
<s> let me see how is it to be managed </s>
<s> suppose ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was what </s>
<s> alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances </s>
<s> there was large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it </s>
<s> she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> advice from caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in languid sleepy voice </s>
<s> who are you said the caterpillar </s>
<s> this was not an encouraging opening for conversation </s>
<s> alice replied rather shyly hardly know sir just at present at least know who was when got up this morning but think must have been changed several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly </s>
<s> explain yourself can't explain myself i'm afraid sir said alice because i'm not myself you see don't see said the caterpillar </s>
<s> i'm afraid can't put it more clearly alice replied very politely for can't understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in day is very confusing it isn't said the caterpillar </s>
<s> well perhaps you haven't found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into butterfly should think you'll feel it little queer won't you not bit said the caterpillar </s>
<s> well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all know is it would feel very queer to me you said the caterpillar contemptuously </s>
<s> who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation </s>
<s> alice felt little irritated at the caterpillar's making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the caterpillar </s>
<s> here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in very unpleasant state of mind she turned away </s>
<s> come back the caterpillar called after her </s>
<s> i've something important to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again </s>
<s> keep your temper said the caterpillar </s>
<s> is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could </s>
<s> no said the caterpillar </s>
<s> alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing </s>
<s> for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think you're changed do you i'm afraid am sir said alice can't remember things as used and don't keep the same size for ten minutes together can't remember what things said the caterpillar </s>
<s> well i've tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in very melancholy voice </s>
<s> repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar </s>
<s> alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right in my youth father william replied to his son feared it might injure the brain but now that i'm perfectly sure have none why do it again and again you are old said the youth as mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned back somersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow me to sell you couple you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it in my youth said his father took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever have answered three questions and that is enough said his father don't give yourself airs </s>
<s> do you think can listen all day to such stuff </s>
<s> be off or i'll kick you down stairs that is not said right said the caterpillar </s>
<s> not quite right i'm afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes </s>
<s> the caterpillar was the first to speak </s>
<s> what size do you want to be it asked </s>
<s> oh i'm not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesn't like changing so often you know don't know said the caterpillar </s>
<s> alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper </s>
<s> are you content now said the caterpillar </s>
<s> well should like to be little larger sir if you wouldn't mind said alice three inches is such wretched height to be it is very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high </s>
<s> but i'm not used to it pleaded poor alice in piteous tone </s>
<s> and she thought of herself wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended you'll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again </s>
<s> this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again </s>
<s> in minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself </s>
<s> then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of what </s>
<s> the other side of what thought alice to herself </s>
<s> of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight </s>
<s> alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this very difficult question </s>
<s> however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off bit of the edge with each hand </s>
<s> and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot </s>
<s> she was good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit </s>
<s> her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow morsel of the lefthand bit </s>
<s> come my head's free at last said alice in tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like stalk out of sea of green leaves that lay far below her </s>
<s> what can all that green stuff be said alice </s>
<s> and where have my shoulders got to </s>
<s> and oh my poor hands how is it can't see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except little shaking among the distant green leaves </s>
<s> as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like serpent </s>
<s> she had just succeeded in curving it down into graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when sharp hiss made her draw back in hurry large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings </s>
<s> serpent screamed the pigeon </s>
<s> i'm not serpent said alice indignantly </s>
<s> let me alone serpent say again repeated the pigeon but in more subdued tone and added with kind of sob i've tried every way and nothing seems to suit them haven't the least idea what you're talking about said alice </s>
<s> i've tried the roots of trees and i've tried banks and i've tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents </s>
<s> there's no pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished </s>
<s> as if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but must be on the look out for serpents night and day </s>
<s> why haven't had wink of sleep these three weeks i'm very sorry you've been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning </s>
<s> and just as i'd taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to shriek and just as was thinking should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky </s>
<s> ugh serpent but i'm not serpent tell you said alice </s>
<s> i'm i'm well </s>
<s> what are you said the pigeon </s>
<s> can see you're trying to invent something i'm little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day </s>
<s> likely story indeed said the pigeon in tone of the deepest contempt </s>
<s> i've seen good many little girls in my time but never one with such neck as that </s>
<s> no no </s>
<s> you're serpent and there's no use denying it </s>
<s> suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know don't believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then they're kind of serpent that's all can say this was such new idea to alice that she was quite silent for minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding you're looking for eggs know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether you're little girl or serpent it matters good deal to me said alice hastily but i'm not looking for eggs as it happens and if was shouldn't want yours don't like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest </s>
<s> alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it </s>
<s> after while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height </s>
<s> it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in few minutes and began talking to herself as usual </s>
<s> come there's half my plan done now </s>
<s> how puzzling all these changes are </s>
<s> i'm never sure what i'm going to be from one minute to another </s>
<s> however i've got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with little house in it about four feet high </s>
<s> whoever lives there thought alice it'll never do to come upon them this size why should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high </s>
<s> chapter vi </s>
<s> pig and pepper for minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles </s>
<s> it was opened by another footman in livery with round face and large eyes like frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads </s>
<s> she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept little way out of the wood to listen </s>
<s> the fish footman began by producing from under his arm great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in solemn tone for the duchess </s>
<s> an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words little from the queen </s>
<s> an invitation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together </s>
<s> alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky </s>
<s> alice went timidly up to the door and knocked </s>
<s> there's no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons </s>
<s> first because i'm on the same side of the door as you are secondly because they're making such noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was most extraordinary noise going on within constant howling and sneezing and every now and then great crash as if dish or kettle had been broken to pieces </s>
<s> please then said alice how am to get in there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us </s>
<s> for instance if you were inside you might knock and could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil </s>
<s> but perhaps he can't help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head </s>
<s> but at any rate he might answer questions how am to get in she repeated aloud </s>
<s> shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and large plate came skimming out straight at the footman's head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him </s>
<s> or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened </s>
<s> how am to get in asked alice again in louder tone </s>
<s> are you to get in at all said the footman </s>
<s> that's the first question you know it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so </s>
<s> it's really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue </s>
<s> it's enough to drive one crazy the footman seemed to think this good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations </s>
<s> shall sit here he said on and off for days and days but what am to do said alice </s>
<s> anything you like said the footman and began whistling </s>
<s> oh there's no use in talking to him said alice desperately he's perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in </s>
<s> the door led right into large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on three legged stool in the middle nursing baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup </s>
<s> there's certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing </s>
<s> there was certainly too much of it in the air </s>
<s> even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without moment's pause </s>
<s> the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear </s>
<s> please would you tell me said alice little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that it's cheshire cat said the duchess and that's why </s>
<s> pig she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again didn't know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact didn't know that cats could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do don't know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into conversation </s>
<s> you don't know much said the duchess and that's fact alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation </s>
<s> while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came first then followed shower of saucepans plates and dishes </s>
<s> the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not </s>
<s> oh please mind what you're doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror </s>
<s> oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off </s>
<s> if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in hoarse growl the world would go round deal faster than it does which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off little of her knowledge </s>
<s> just think of what work it would make with the day and night </s>
<s> you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four hours think or is it twelve </s>
<s> oh don't bother me said the duchess never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it violent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases chorus </s>
<s> in which the cook and the baby joined wow </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> wow while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words speak severely to my boy beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases chorus </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> wow here </s>
<s> you may nurse it bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke </s>
<s> must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room </s>
<s> the cook threw frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her </s>
<s> alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was queer shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like star fish thought alice </s>
<s> the poor little thing was snorting like steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it </s>
<s> as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air </s>
<s> if don't take this child away with me thought alice they're sure to kill it in day or two wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time </s>
<s> don't grunt said alice that's not at all proper way of expressing yourself the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it </s>
<s> there could be no doubt that it had very turn up nose much more like snout than real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all </s>
<s> but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears </s>
<s> no there were no tears </s>
<s> if you're going to turn into pig my dear said alice seriously i'll have nothing more to do with you </s>
<s> mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence </s>
<s> alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am to do with this creature when get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm </s>
<s> this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further </s>
<s> so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood </s>
<s> if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather handsome pig think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on bough of tree few yards off </s>
<s> the cat only grinned when it saw alice </s>
<s> it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect </s>
<s> cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned little wider </s>
<s> come it's pleased so far thought alice and she went on </s>
<s> would you tell me please which way ought to go from here that depends good deal on where you want to get to said the cat </s>
<s> don't much care where said alice </s>
<s> then it doesn't matter which way you go said the cat </s>
<s> so long as get somewhere alice added as an explanation </s>
<s> oh you're sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question </s>
<s> what sort of people live about here in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives march hare </s>
<s> visit either you like they're both mad but don't want to go among mad people alice remarked </s>
<s> oh you can't help that said the cat we're all mad here </s>
<s> i'm mad </s>
<s> you're mad how do you know i'm mad said alice </s>
<s> you must be said the cat or you wouldn't have come here alice didn't think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that you're mad to begin with said the cat dog's not mad </s>
<s> you grant that suppose so said alice </s>
<s> well then the cat went on you see dog growls when it's angry and wags its tail when it's pleased </s>
<s> now growl when i'm pleased and wag my tail when i'm angry </s>
<s> therefore i'm mad call it purring not growling said alice </s>
<s> call it what you like said the cat </s>
<s> do you play croquet with the queen to day should like it very much said alice but haven't been invited yet you'll see me there said the cat and vanished </s>
<s> alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening </s>
<s> while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again </s>
<s> by the bye what became of the baby said the cat </s>
<s> i'd nearly forgotten to ask it turned into pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in natural way </s>
<s> thought it would said the cat and vanished again </s>
<s> alice waited little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live </s>
<s> i've seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it won't be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on branch of tree </s>
<s> did you say pig or fig said the cat </s>
<s> said pig replied alice and wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> i've often seen cat without grin thought alice but grin without cat </s>
<s> it's the most curious thing ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur </s>
<s> it was so large house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all </s>
<s> almost wish i'd gone to see the hatter instead chapter vii </s>
<s> mad tea party there was table set out under tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head </s>
<s> very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as it's asleep suppose it doesn't mind the table was large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room </s>
<s> no room they cried out when they saw alice coming </s>
<s> there's plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in large arm chair at one end of the table </s>
<s> have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone </s>
<s> alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea </s>
<s> don't see any wine she remarked </s>
<s> there isn't any said the march hare </s>
<s> then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily </s>
<s> it wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare </s>
<s> didn't know it was your table said alice it's laid for great many more than three your hair wants cutting said the hatter </s>
<s> he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech </s>
<s> you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity it's very rude the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is raven like writing desk come we shall have some fun now thought alice </s>
<s> i'm glad they've begun asking riddles believe can guess that she added aloud </s>
<s> do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare </s>
<s> exactly so said alice </s>
<s> then you should say what you mean the march hare went on </s>
<s> do alice hastily replied at least at least mean what say that's the same thing you know not the same thing bit said the hatter </s>
<s> you might just as well say that see what eat is the same thing as eat what see you might just as well say added the march hare that like what get is the same thing as get what like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that breathe when sleep is the same thing as sleep when breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasn't much </s>
<s> the hatter was the first to break the silence </s>
<s> what day of the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear </s>
<s> alice considered little and then said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter </s>
<s> told you butter wouldn't suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare </s>
<s> it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied </s>
<s> yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldn't have put it in with the bread knife the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity </s>
<s> what funny watch she remarked </s>
<s> it tells the day of the month and doesn't tell what o'clock it is why should it muttered the hatter </s>
<s> does your watch tell you what year it is of course not alice replied very readily but that's because it stays the same year for such long time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter </s>
<s> alice felt dreadfully puzzled </s>
<s> the hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english </s>
<s> don't quite understand you she said as politely as she could </s>
<s> the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured little hot tea upon its nose </s>
<s> the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what was going to remark myself have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again </s>
<s> no give it up alice replied what's the answer haven't the slightest idea said the hatter </s>
<s> nor said the march hare </s>
<s> alice sighed wearily </s>
<s> think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers if you knew time as well as do said the hatter you wouldn't talk about wasting it </s>
<s> it's him don't know what you mean said alice </s>
<s> of course you don't the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously </s>
<s> dare say you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but know have to beat time when learn music ah </s>
<s> that accounts for it said the hatter </s>
<s> he won't stand beating </s>
<s> now if you only kept on good terms with him he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock </s>
<s> for instance suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning just time to begin lessons you'd only have to whisper hint to time and round goes the clock in twinkling </s>
<s> half past one time for dinner only wish it was the march hare said to itself in whisper that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then shouldn't be hungry for it you know not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked </s>
<s> the hatter shook his head mournfully </s>
<s> not he replied </s>
<s> we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat </s>
<s> how wonder what you're at you know the song perhaps i've heard something like it said alice </s>
<s> it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way up above the world you fly like tea tray in the sky </s>
<s> twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop </s>
<s> well i'd hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out he's murdering the time </s>
<s> off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice </s>
<s> and ever since that the hatter went on in mournful tone he won't do thing ask </s>
<s> it's always six o'clock now bright idea came into alice's head </s>
<s> is that the reason so many tea things are put out here she asked </s>
<s> yes that's it said the hatter with sigh it's always tea time and we've no time to wash the things between whiles then you keep moving round suppose said alice </s>
<s> exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask </s>
<s> suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning </s>
<s> i'm getting tired of this </s>
<s> vote the young lady tells us story i'm afraid don't know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal </s>
<s> then the dormouse shall they both cried </s>
<s> wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once </s>
<s> the dormouse slowly opened his eyes </s>
<s> wasn't asleep he said in hoarse feeble voice heard every word you fellows were saying tell us story said the march hare </s>
<s> yes please do pleaded alice </s>
<s> and be quick about it added the hatter or you'll be asleep again before it's done once upon time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of well what did they live on said alice who always took great interest in questions of eating and drinking </s>
<s> they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking minute or two </s>
<s> they couldn't have done that you know alice gently remarked they'd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of well take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly </s>
<s> i've had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so can't take more you mean you can't take less said the hatter it's very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice </s>
<s> who's making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly </s>
<s> alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question </s>
<s> why did they live at the bottom of well the dormouse again took minute or two to think about it and then said it was treacle well there's no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh </s>
<s> sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you can't be civil you'd better finish the story for yourself no please go on alice said very humbly won't interrupt again </s>
<s> dare say there may be one one indeed said the dormouse indignantly </s>
<s> however he consented to go on </s>
<s> and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise </s>
<s> treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time </s>
<s> want clean cup interrupted the hatter let's all move one place on he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse's place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare </s>
<s> the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate </s>
<s> alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but don't understand </s>
<s> where did they draw the treacle from you can draw water out of water well said the hatter so should think you could draw treacle out of treacle well eh stupid but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark </s>
<s> of course they were said the dormouse well in this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it </s>

<s> why not said the march hare </s>
<s> alice was silent </s>
<s> the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with little shriek and went on that begins with an such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of muchness did you ever see such thing as drawing of muchness really now you ask me said alice very much confused don't think then you shouldn't talk said the hatter </s>
<s> this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot </s>
<s> at any rate i'll never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood </s>
<s> it's the stupidest tea party ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had door leading right into it </s>
<s> that's very curious she thought </s>
<s> but everything's curious today </s>
<s> think may as well go in at once and in she went </s>
<s> once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table </s>
<s> now i'll manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden </s>
<s> then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept piece of it in her pocket till she was about foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains </s>

<s> that's none of your business two said seven </s>
<s> yes it is his business said five and i'll tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low </s>
<s> would you tell me said alice little timidly why you are painting those roses five and seven said nothing but looked at two </s>
<s> two began in low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been red rose tree and we put white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know </s>
<s> so you see miss we're doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen </s>
<s> the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces </s>
<s> there was sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen </s>
<s> first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did </s>
<s> after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts </s>
<s> next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her </s>
<s> then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king's crown on crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts </s>
<s> alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such rule at processions and besides what would be the use of procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldn't see it so she stood still where she was and waited </s>
<s> when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply </s>

<s> needn't be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children </s>
<s> how should know said alice surprised at her own courage </s>
<s> it's no business of mine the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for moment like wild beast screamed off with her head </s>
<s> off nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent </s>
<s> the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so very carefully with one foot </s>
<s> get up said the queen in shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else </s>
<s> leave off that screamed the queen </s>
<s> you make me giddy and then turning to the rose tree she went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty said two in very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses </s>
<s> off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection </s>
<s> you shan't be beheaded said alice and she put them into large flower pot that stood near </s>

<s> their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted in reply </s>
<s> that's right shouted the queen </s>
<s> can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her </s>
<s> yes shouted alice </s>
<s> come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next </s>
<s> it's it's very fine day said timid voice at her side </s>
<s> she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face </s>
<s> very said alice where's the duchess hush </s>
<s> hush said the rabbit in low hurried tone </s>

<s> you see she came rather late and the queen said get to your places shouted the queen in voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in minute or two and the game began </s>
<s> alice thought she had never seen such curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches </s>
<s> the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was very difficult game indeed </s>
<s> the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in very short time the queen was in furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in minute </s>
<s> alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me </s>
<s> they're dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that there's any one left alive she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it minute or two she made it out to be grin and she said to herself it's the cheshire cat now shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with </s>
<s> alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded </s>
<s> it's no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her </s>
<s> the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared </s>
<s> don't think they play at all fairly alice began in rather complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak and they don't seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance there's the arch i've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and should have croqueted the queen's hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming how do you like the queen said the cat in low voice </s>
<s> not at all said alice she's so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that it's hardly worth while finishing the game the queen smiled and passed on </s>
<s> who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cat's head with great curiosity </s>
<s> it's friend of mine cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it don't like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes i'd rather not the cat remarked </s>
<s> don't be impertinent said the king and don't look at me like that he got behind alice as he spoke </s>
<s> cat may look at king said alice </s>
<s> i've read that in some book but don't remember where well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear </s>
<s> wish you would have this cat removed the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small </s>
<s> off with his head she said without even looking round </s>
<s> i'll fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off </s>
<s> alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen's voice in the distance screaming with passion </s>
<s> she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not </s>
<s> so she went in search of her hedgehog </s>
<s> the hedgehog was engaged in fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in helpless sort of way to fly up into tree </s>
<s> by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn't matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for little more conversation with her friend </s>
<s> when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite large crowd collected round it there was dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable </s>
<s> the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said </s>
<s> the executioner's argument was that you couldn't cut off head unless there was body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such thing before and he wasn't going to begin at his time of life </s>
<s> the king's argument was that anything that had head could be beheaded and that you weren't to talk nonsense </s>
<s> the queen's argument was that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed all round </s>
<s> it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess you'd better ask her about it she's in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here and the executioner went off like an arrow </s>
<s> the cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game </s>
<s> chapter ix </s>
<s> the mock turtle's story you can't think how glad am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice's and they walked off together </s>
<s> alice was very glad to find her in such pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen </s>
<s> when i'm duchess she said to herself not in very hopeful tone though won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all </s>
<s> soup does very well without maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered </s>
<s> only wish people knew that then they wouldn't be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear </s>
<s> you're thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk </s>
<s> can't tell you just now what the moral of that is but shall remember it in bit perhaps it hasn't one alice ventured to remark </s>
<s> tut tut child said the duchess </s>
<s> everything's got moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alice's side as she spoke </s>
<s> alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice's shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin </s>
<s> however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could </s>
<s> the game's going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation little </s>
<s> tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice whispered that it's done by everybody minding their own business ah well </s>
<s> it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice's shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself </s>
<s> dare say you're wondering why don't put my arm round your waist the duchess said after pause the reason is that i'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo </s>
<s> shall try the experiment he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried </s>
<s> very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite </s>
<s> and the moral of that is birds of feather flock together only mustard isn't bird alice remarked </s>
<s> right as usual said the duchess what clear way you have of putting things it's mineral think said alice </s>
<s> of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said there's large mustard mine near here </s>
<s> and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours oh know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark it's vegetable </s>
<s> it doesn't look like one but it is quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if you'd like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise think should understand that better alice said very politely if had it written down but can't quite follow it as you say it that's nothing to what could say if chose the duchess replied in pleased tone </s>
<s> pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice </s>
<s> oh don't talk about trouble said the duchess </s>
<s> make you present of everything i've said as yet cheap sort of present thought alice </s>
<s> i'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out loud </s>
<s> thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin </s>
<s> i've right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel little worried </s>
<s> just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the but here to alice's great surprise the duchess's voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble </s>
<s> alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like thunderstorm </s>
<s> fine day your majesty the duchess began in low weak voice </s>
<s> now give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time </s>
<s> take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in moment </s>
<s> let's go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground </s>
<s> the other guests had taken advantage of the queen's absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that moment's delay would cost them their lives </s>
<s> all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution </s>
<s> then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet no said alice </s>
<s> don't even know what mock turtle is it's the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen </s>
<s> never saw one or heard of one said alice </s>
<s> come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king say in low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come that's good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered </s>
<s> they very soon came upon gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun </s>
<s> if you don't know what gryphon is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history </s>
<s> must go back and see after some executions have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon </s>
<s> alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited </s>
<s> the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled </s>
<s> what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice </s>
<s> what is the fun said alice </s>
<s> why she said the gryphon </s>
<s> it's all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know </s>
<s> come on everybody says come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it never was so ordered about in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break </s>
<s> she pitied him deeply </s>
<s> what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before it's all his fancy that he hasn't got no sorrow you know </s>
<s> come on so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing </s>
<s> this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do i'll tell it her said the mock turtle in deep hollow tone sit down both of you and don't speak word till i've finished so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes </s>
<s> alice thought to herself don't see how he can even finish if he doesn't begin but she waited patiently </s>
<s> once said the mock turtle at last with deep sigh was real turtle these words were followed by very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle </s>
<s> alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing </s>
<s> when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing little now and then we went to school in the sea </s>
<s> the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasn't one alice asked </s>
<s> we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth </s>
<s> at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow </s>
<s> don't be all day about it and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn't believe it never said didn't interrupted alice </s>
<s> you did said the mock turtle </s>
<s> hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again </s>
<s> the mock turtle went on </s>
<s> we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day i've been to day school too said alice you needn't be so proud as all that with extras asked the mock turtle little anxiously </s>
<s> yes said alice we learned french and music and washing said the mock turtle </s>
<s> certainly not said alice indignantly </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s> then yours wasn't really good school said the mock turtle in tone of great relief </s>
<s> now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washing extra you couldn't have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea couldn't afford to learn it said the mock turtle with sigh </s>
<s> only took the regular course what was that inquired alice </s>
<s> reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision never heard of uglification alice ventured to say </s>
<s> what is it the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> never heard of uglifying it exclaimed </s>
<s> you know what to beautify is suppose yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier well then the gryphon went on if you don't know what to uglify is you are simpleton alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils what was that like said alice </s>
<s> well can't show it you myself the mock turtle said i'm too stiff </s>
<s> and the gryphon never learnt it hadn't time said the gryphon went to the classics master though </s>
<s> he was an old crab he was never went to him the mock turtle said with sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws </s>
<s> and how many hours day did you do lessons said alice in hurry to change the subject </s>
<s> ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on what curious plan exclaimed alice </s>
<s> that's the reason they're called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day this was quite new idea to alice and she thought it over little before she made her next remark </s>
<s> then the eleventh day must have been holiday of course it was said the mock turtle </s>
<s> and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly </s>
<s> that's enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in very decided tone tell her something about the games now chapter </s>
<s> the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes </s>
<s> he looked at alice and tried to speak but for minute or two sobs choked his voice </s>
<s> same as if he had bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back </s>
<s> at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again you may not have lived much under the sea haven't said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to lobster alice began to say once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what delightful thing lobster quadrille is no indeed said alice </s>
<s> what sort of dance is it why said the gryphon you first form into line along the sea shore two lines cried the mock turtle </s>
<s> seals turtles salmon and so on then when you've cleared all the jelly fish out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon </s>
<s> you advance twice each with lobster as partner cried the gryphon </s>
<s> of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon </s>
<s> then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the the lobsters shouted the gryphon with bound into the air </s>
<s> as far out to sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon </s>
<s> turn somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about </s>
<s> change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice </s>
<s> back to land again and that's all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice </s>
<s> it must be very pretty dance said alice timidly </s>
<s> would you like to see little of it said the mock turtle </s>
<s> very much indeed said alice </s>
<s> come let's try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon </s>
<s> we can do without lobsters you know </s>
<s> which shall sing oh you sing said the gryphon </s>
<s> i've forgotten the words so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly will you walk little faster said whiting to snail </s>
<s> there's porpoise close behind us and he's treading on my tail </s>
<s> see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance </s>
<s> they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance </s>
<s> will you won't you will you won't you will you join the dance </s>
<s> will you won't you will you won't you won't you join the dance </s>
<s> you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance </s>
<s> would not could not would not could not would not join the dance </s>
<s> would not could not would not could not could not join the dance </s>
<s> what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied </s>
<s> there is another shore you know upon the other side </s>
<s> the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance </s>
<s> will you won't you will you won't you will you join the dance </s>
<s> will you won't you will you won't you won't you join the dance thank you it's very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and do so like that curious song about the whiting oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they you've seen them of course yes said alice i've often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily </s>
<s> don't know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if you've seen them so often of course you know what they're like believe so alice replied thoughtfully </s>
<s> they have their tails in their mouths and they're all over crumbs you're wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea </s>
<s> but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon </s>
<s> the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance </s>
<s> so they got thrown out to sea </s>
<s> so they had to fall long way </s>
<s> so they got their tails fast in their mouths </s>
<s> so they couldn't get them out again </s>
<s> that's all thank you said alice it's very interesting </s>
<s> never knew so much about whiting before can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon </s>
<s> do you know why it's called whiting never thought about it said alice </s>
<s> why it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly </s>
<s> alice was thoroughly puzzled </s>
<s> does the boots and shoes she repeated in wondering tone </s>
<s> why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon </s>
<s> mean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered little before she gave her answer </s>
<s> they're done with blacking believe boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in deep voice are done with whiting </s>
<s> now you know and what are they made of alice asked in tone of great curiosity </s>
<s> soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that if i'd been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song i'd have said to the porpoise keep back please we don't want you with us they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise wouldn't it really said alice in tone of great surprise </s>
<s> of course not said the mock turtle why if fish came to me and told me he was going journey should say with what porpoise don't you mean purpose said alice </s>
<s> mean what say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone </s>
<s> and the gryphon added come let's hear some of your adventures could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice little timidly but it's no use going back to yesterday because was different person then explain all that said the mock turtle </s>
<s> no no </s>
<s> the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such dreadful time so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit </s>
<s> she was little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on </s>
<s> her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew long breath and said that's very curious it's all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon </s>
<s> it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully </s>
<s> should like to hear her try and repeat something now </s>
<s> tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice </s>
<s> stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon </s>
<s> how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster heard him declare you have baked me too brown must sugar my hair as duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has timid and tremulous sound that's different from what used to say when was child said the gryphon </s>
<s> well never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in natural way again </s>
<s> should like to have it explained said the mock turtle </s>
<s> she can't explain it said the gryphon hastily </s>
<s> go on with the next verse but about his toes the mock turtle persisted </s>
<s> how could he turn them out with his nose you know it's the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject </s>
<s> go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins passed by his garden alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in trembling voice passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing pie later editions continued as follows the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat </s>
<s> when the pie was all finished the owl as boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you don't explain it as you go on </s>
<s> it's by far the most confusing thing ever heard yes think you'd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so </s>
<s> shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on </s>
<s> or would you like the mock turtle to sing you song oh song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in rather offended tone hm </s>
<s> no accounting for tastes </s>
<s> sing her turtle soup will you old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in hot tureen </s>

<s> alice's evidence here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before </s>
<s> oh beg your pardon she exclaimed in tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die </s>

<s> she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other as soon as the jury had little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court </s>
<s> what do you know about this business the king said to alice </s>
<s> nothing said alice </s>
<s> nothing whatever persisted the king </s>

<s> at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence and read out from his book rule forty two </s>

<s> you are said the king </s>
<s> nearly two miles high added the queen </s>
<s> well shan't go at any rate said alice besides that's not regular rule you invented it just now it's the oldest rule in the book said the king </s>
<s> then it ought to be number one said alice </s>
<s> the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily </s>
<s> consider your verdict he said to the jury in low trembling voice </s>
<s> there's more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in great hurry this paper has just been picked up what's in it said the queen </s>
<s> haven't opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be letter written by the prisoner to to somebody it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isn't usual you know who is it directed to said one of the jurymen </s>
<s> it isn't directed at all said the white rabbit in fact there's nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn't letter after all it's set of verses are they in the prisoner's handwriting asked another of the jurymen </s>
<s> no they're not said the white rabbit and that's the queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled he must have imitated somebody else's hand said the king </s>
<s> the jury all brightened up again please your majesty said the knave didn't write it and they can't prove did there's no name signed at the end if you didn't sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse </s>
<s> you must have meant some mischief or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man there was general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day </s>
<s> that proves his guilt said the queen </s>
<s> it proves nothing of the sort said alice </s>
<s> why you don't even know what they're about read them said the king </s>
<s> the white rabbit put on his spectacles </s>
<s> where shall begin please your majesty he asked </s>
<s> begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me good character but said could not swim </s>
<s> he sent them word had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you </s>
<s> gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before </s>

<s> my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it </s>
<s> don't let him know she liked them best for this must ever be secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me that's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't bit afraid of interrupting him i'll give him sixpence </s>
<s> don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper </s>
<s> if there's no meaning in it said the king that saves world of trouble you know as we needn't try to find any </s>
<s> and yet don't know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye seem to see some meaning in them after all </s>
<s> said could not swim you can't swim can you he added turning to the knave </s>
<s> the knave shook his head sadly </s>
<s> do look like it he said </s>
<s> which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true that's the jury of course gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice </s>
<s> why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table </s>
<s> nothing can be clearer than that </s>
<s> then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear think he said to the queen </s>
<s> never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke </s>
<s> the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted then the words don't fit you said the king looking round the court with smile </s>
<s> there was dead silence </s>
<s> it's pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day </s>
<s> no no said the queen </s>
<s> sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and nonsense said alice loudly </s>
<s> the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the queen turning purple </s>
<s> won't said alice </s>
<s> off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice </s>
<s> nobody moved </s>
<s> who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time you're nothing but pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face </s>
<s> wake up alice dear said her sister why what long sleep you've had oh i've had such curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it's getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what wonderful dream it had been </s>
<s> but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream </s>
<s> the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchess's knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard's slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle </s>
<s> so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle's heavy sobs </s>
<s> lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days </s>

<s> chapter illustration alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and where is the use of book thought alice without pictures or conversations </s>
<s> so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making daisy chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her </s>
<s> there was nothing very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself dear dear </s>
<s> shall be too late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took watch out of its waistcoat pocket looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen rabbit with either waistcoat pocket or watch to take out of it and full of curiosity she hurried across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down large rabbit hole under the hedge </s>
<s> in moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again </s>
<s> the rabbit hole went straight on like tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed deep well </s>
<s> either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what would happen next </s>
<s> first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there were maps and pictures hung on pegs </s>
<s> she took jar down off one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it </s>
<s> well thought alice to herself after such fall as this shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs </s>
<s> how brave they'll all think me at home </s>
<s> why wouldn't say anything about it even if fell off the top of the house which was most likely true down down down </s>
<s> would the fall never come to an end </s>
<s> wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time she said aloud must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth </s>
<s> let me see that would be four thousand miles down think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not very good opportunity of showing off her knowledge as there was no one to hear her still it was good practice to say it over yes that's the right distance but then what longitude or latitude line shall be in alice had no idea what longitude was or latitude either but she thought they were nice grand words to say presently she began again wonder if shall fall right through the earth </s>
<s> how funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards </s>
<s> but shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know </s>
<s> please ma'am is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air </s>
<s> do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking </s>
<s> no it'll never do to ask perhaps shall see it written up somewhere down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again </s>
<s> dinah will miss me very much tonight should think dinah was the cat hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea time </s>
<s> oh dear dinah wish had you here </s>
<s> there are no mice in the air i'm afraid but you might catch bat and that's very like mouse you know my dear </s>
<s> but do cats eat bats wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and kept on saying to herself in dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats </s>
<s> do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for as she couldn't answer either question it didn't much matter which way she put it </s>
<s> she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and was saying to her very earnestly now dinah my dear tell me the truth </s>
<s> did you ever eat bat when suddenly bump </s>
<s> bump </s>
<s> down she came upon heap of sticks and shavings and the fall was over </s>
<s> alice was not bit hurt and jumped on to her feet directly she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it </s>
<s> there was not moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and just heard it say as it turned corner my ears and whiskers how late it's getting she turned the corner after it and instantly found herself in long low hall lit up by row of lamps which hung from the roof </s>
<s> illustration there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all round it and tried them all she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing lying upon it but tiny golden key and alice's first idea was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas </s>
<s> either the locks were too large or the key too small but at any rate it would open none of them </s>
<s> however on the second time round she came to low curtain behind which was door about eighteen inches high she tried the little key in the keyhole and it fitted </s>
<s> alice opened the door and looked down small passage not larger than rat hole into the loveliest garden you ever saw </s>
<s> how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be very little use without my shoulders </s>
<s> oh how wish could shut up like telescope </s>
<s> think could if only knew how to begin for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice began to think very few things indeed were really impossible </s>
<s> there was nothing else to do so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes this time there was little bottle on it which certainly was not there before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters </s>
<s> it was all very well to say drink me but i'll look first said the wise little alice and see whether the bottle's marked poison or not for alice had read several nice little stories about children that got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them such as that if you get into the fire it will burn you and that if you cut your finger very deeply with knife it generally bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later </s>
<s> however this bottle was not marked poison so alice tasted it and finding it very nice it had in fact sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffy and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off </s>
<s> what curious feeling said alice must be shutting up like telescope it was so indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden </s>
<s> first however she waited for few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further she felt little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like candle and what should be like then wonder and she tried to fancy what the flame of candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember having ever seen one </s>
<s> however nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice </s>
<s> when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for the key she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it plainly enough through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried </s>
<s> illustration come </s>
<s> there's no use in crying said alice to herself rather sharply advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in game of croquet she was playing with herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but it's no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people </s>
<s> why there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eyes fell on little ebony box lying under the table she opened it and found in it very small cake on which was lying card with the words eat me beautifully printed on it in large letters </s>
<s> i'll eat said alice and if it makes me larger can reach the key and if it makes me smaller can creep under the door so either way i'll get into the garden and don't care which happens she ate little bit and said anxiously to herself which way </s>
<s> which way and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen and it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way </s>
<s> so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake </s>
<s> curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to speak good english now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was </s>
<s> goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears </s>
<s> i'm sure can't </s>
<s> shall be great deal too far off to bother myself about you you must manage the best way you can but must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they won't walk the way want to go </s>
<s> let me see i'll give them new pair of boots every christmas illustration and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny it'll seem sending presents to one's own feet </s>
<s> and how odd the directions will look </s>
<s> alice's right foot esq </s>
<s> the carpet with alice's love oh dear </s>
<s> what nonsense am talking just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door </s>
<s> poor alice </s>
<s> it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and cried again </s>
<s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice great girl like you she might well say this to cry in this way </s>
<s> stop this instant tell you but she cried on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was large pool about four inches deep all round her and reaching half way across the hall </s>
<s> after time she heard little pattering of feet in the distance and dried her eyes to see what was coming </s>
<s> it was the white rabbit coming back again splendidly dressed with pair of white kid gloves in one hand and nosegay in the other </s>
<s> alice was ready to ask help of any one she felt so desperate and as the rabbit passed her she said in low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently looked up once into the roof of the hall from which the voice seemed to come and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves and skurried away into the darkness as hard as it could go </s>
<s> illustration alice took up the nosegay and gloves and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself dear dear </s>
<s> how queer everything is today </s>
<s> and yesterday everything happened just as usual wonder if was changed in the night </s>
<s> let me think was the same when got up this morning </s>
<s> think remember feeling rather different </s>
<s> but if i'm not the same who in the world am </s>
<s> ah that's the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them </s>
<s> i'm sure i'm not gertrude she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all and i'm sure ca'n be florence for know all sorts of things and she oh </s>
<s> she knows such very little </s>
<s> besides she's she and i'm and oh dear </s>

<s> i'll try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap and began but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not sound the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve its shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale </s>
<s> how cheerfully it seems to grin </s>
<s> how neatly spreads its claws </s>
<s> and welcomes little fishes in with gently smiling jaws i'm sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears as she thought must be florence after all and shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh </s>
<s> ever so many lessons to learn </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> i've made up my mind about it if i'm florence i'll stay down here </s>
<s> it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up dear shall only look up and say who am then </s>
<s> answer me that first and then if like being that person i'll come up if not i'll stay down here till i'm somebody else but oh dear cried alice with sudden burst of tears do wish they would put their heads down </s>
<s> am so tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to find she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while she was talking </s>
<s> how can have done that thought she must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly soon she found out that the reason of it was the nosegay she held in her hand she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether and found that she was now only three inches high </s>
<s> now for the garden cried alice as she hurried back to the little door but the little door was locked again and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor little girl for never was as small as this before never </s>
<s> and declare it's too bad it is illustration at this moment her foot slipped and splash </s>
<s> she was up to her chin in salt water </s>
<s> her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea then she remembered that she was under ground and she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high </s>
<s> wish hadn't cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out shall be punished for it now suppose by being drowned in my own tears </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> that'll be queer thing to be sure </s>
<s> however every thing is queer today very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool near her at first she thought it must be walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was herself and soon made out that it was only mouse that had slipped in like herself </s>
<s> would it be any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse </s>
<s> the rabbit is something quite out of the way no doubt and so have been ever since came down here but that is no reason why the mouse should not be able to talk </s>

<s> come </s>

<s> alice thought she had never seen such curious croquet ground in all her life it was all in ridges and furrows the croquet balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live ostriches and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their feet and hands to make the arches </s>
<s> illustration illustration the chief difficulty which alice found at first was to manage her ostrich she got its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely and was going to give blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up into her face with such puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally ridge or furrow in her way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was very difficult game indeed </s>
<s> the players all played at once without waiting for turns and quarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices and in very few minutes the queen was in furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head of off with her head about once in minute </s>

<s> on stamp cases some american writer has said the snakes in this district may be divided into one species the venomous the same principle applies here </s>
<s> postage stamp cases may be divided into one species the wonderland imitations of it will soon appear no doubt but they cannot include the two pictorial surprises which are copyright </s>
<s> you don't see why call them surprises </s>
<s> well take the case in your left hand and regard it attentively </s>
<s> you see alice nursing the duchess's baby </s>
<s> an entirely new combination by the way it doesn't occur in the book now with your right thumb and forefinger lay hold of the little book and suddenly pull it out </s>
<s> the baby has turned into pig if that doesn't surprise you why suppose you wouldn't be surprised if your own mother in law suddenly turned into gyroscope </s>
<s> this case is not intended to carry about in your pocket </s>
<s> far from it </s>
<s> people seldom want any other stamps on an emergency than penny stamps for letters sixpenny stamps for telegrams and bit of stamp edging for cut fingers it makes capital sticking plaster and will stand three or four washings cautiously conducted and all these are easily carried in purse or pocketbook </s>
<s> no this is meant to haunt your envelope case or wherever you keep your writing materials </s>
<s> what made me invent it was the constantly wanting stamps of other values for foreign letters parcel post and finding it very bothersome to get at the kind wanted in hurry </s>
<s> since have possessed wonderland stamp case life has been bright and peaceful and have used no other </s>
<s> believe the queen's laundress uses no other </s>
<s> each of the pockets will hold stamps comfortably </s>
<s> would recommend you to arrange the before putting them in something like bouquet making them lean to the right and to the left alternately thus there will always be free corner to get hold of so as to take them out quickly and easily one by one otherwise you will find them apt to come out two or three at time </s>
<s> according to my experience the and stamps are hardly ever wanted though have constantly to replenish all the other pockets </s>
<s> if your experience agrees with mine you may find it convenient to keep only couple say of each of these kinds in the pocket and to fill the other pockets with extra stamps </s>
<s> </s>
<s> how to begin letter if the letter is to be in answer to another begin by getting out that other letter and reading it through in order to refresh your memory as to what it is you have to answer and as to your correspondent's present address otherwise you will be sending your letter to his regular address in london though he has been careful in writing to give you his torquay address in full </s>
<s> next address and stamp the envelope </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> before writing the letter most certainly </s>
<s> and i'll tell you what will happen if you don't </s>
<s> you will go on writing till the last moment and just in the middle of the last sentence you will become aware that time's up then comes the hurried wind up the wildly scrawled signature the hastily fastened envelope which comes open in the post the address mere hieroglyphic the horrible discovery that you've forgotten to replenish your stamp case the frantic appeal to every one in the house to lend you stamp the headlong rush to the post office arriving hot and gasping just after the box has closed and finally week afterwards the return of the letter from the dead letter office marked address illegible </s>
<s> next put your own address in full at the top of the note sheet </s>
<s> it is an aggravating thing speak from bitter experience when friend staying at some new address heads his letter dover simply assuming that you can get the rest of the address from his previous letter which perhaps you have destroyed </s>
<s> next put the date in full </s>
<s> it is another aggravating thing when you wish years afterwards to arrange series of letters to find them dated feb </s>
<s> aug </s>
<s> without any year to guide you as to which comes first </s>
<s> and never never dear madam </s>
<s> this remark is addressed to ladies only no man would ever do such thing put wednesday simply as the date </s>
<s> that way madness lies </s>
<s> how to go on with letter here is golden rule to begin with </s>
<s> write legibly the average temper of the human race would be perceptibly sweetened if everybody obeyed this rule </s>
<s> great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly </s>
<s> of course you reply do it to save time </s>
<s> very good object no doubt but what right have you to do it at your friend's expense </s>
<s> isn't his time as valuable as yours </s>
<s> years ago used to receive letters from friend and very interesting letters too written in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented </s>
<s> it generally took me about week to read one of his letters </s>
<s> used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure times to puzzle over the riddles which composed it holding it in different positions and at different distances till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me when at once wrote down the english under it and when several had been thus guessed the context would help one with the others till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was deciphered </s>
<s> if all one's friends wrote like that life would be entirely spent in reading their letters </s>
<s> this rule applies specially to names of people or places and most specially to foreign names </s>
<s> got letter once containing some russian names written in the same hasty scramble in which people often write yours sincerely </s>
<s> the context of course didn't help in the least and one spelling was just as likely as another so far as knew it was necessary to write and tell my friend that couldn't read any of them </s>
<s> my second rule is don't fill more than page and half with apologies for not having written sooner </s>
<s> the best subject to begin with is your friend's last letter </s>
<s> write with the letter open before you </s>
<s> answer his questions and make any remarks his letter suggests </s>
<s> then go on to what you want to say yourself </s>
<s> this arrangement is more courteous and pleasanter for the reader than to fill the letter with your own invaluable remarks and then hastily answer your friend's questions in postscript </s>
<s> your friend is much more likely to enjoy your wit after his own anxiety for information has been satisfied </s>
<s> in referring to anything your friend has said in his letter it is best to quote the exact words and not to give summary of them in your words </s>
<s> a's impression of what has said expressed in a's words will never convey to the meaning of his own words </s>
<s> this is specially necessary when some point has arisen as to which the two correspondents do not quite agree </s>
<s> there ought to be no opening for such writing as you are quite mistaken in thinking said so and so </s>
<s> it was not in the least my meaning which tends to make correspondence last for lifetime </s>
<s> few more rules may fitly be given here for correspondence that has unfortunately become controversial </s>
<s> one is don't repeat yourself </s>
<s> when once you have said your say fully and clearly on certain point and have failed to convince your friend drop that subject to repeat your arguments all over again will simply lead to his doing the same and so you will go on like circulating decimal </s>
<s> did you ever know circulating decimal come to an end another rule is when you have written letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself put it aside till the next day </s>
<s> then read it over again and fancy it addressed to yourself </s>
<s> this will often lead to your writing it all over again taking out lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey instead and thus making much more palatable dish of it </s>
<s> if when you have done your best to write inoffensively you still feel that it will probably lead to further controversy keep copy of it </s>
<s> there is very little use months afterwards in pleading am almost sure never expressed myself as you say to the best of my recollection said so and so </s>
<s> far better to be able to write did not express myself so these are the words used my fifth rule is if your friend makes severe remark either leave it unnoticed or make your reply distinctly less severe and if he makes friendly remark tending towards making up the little difference that has arisen between you let your reply be distinctly more friendly </s>
<s> if in picking quarrel each party declined to go more than three eighths of the way and if in making friends each was ready to go five eighths of the way why there would be more reconciliations than quarrels </s>
<s> which is like the irishman's remonstrance to his gad about daughter shure you're always goin out </s>
<s> you go out three times for wanst that you come in my sixth rule and my last remark about controversial correspondence is don't try to have the last word </s>
<s> how many controversy would be nipped in the bud if each was anxious to let the other have the last word </s>
<s> never mind how telling rejoinder you leave unuttered never mind your friend's supposing that you are silent from lack of anything to say let the thing drop as soon as it is possible without discourtesy remember speech is silvern but silence is golden </s>
<s> if you are gentleman and your friend lady this rule is superfluous you won't get the last word my seventh rule is if it should ever occur to you to write jestingly in dispraise of your friend be sure you exaggerate enough to make the jesting obvious word spoken in jest but taken as earnest may lead to very serious consequences </s>
<s> have known it to lead to the breaking off of friendship </s>
<s> suppose for instance you wish to remind your friend of sovereign you have lent him which he has forgotten to repay you might quite mean the words mention it as you seem to have conveniently bad memory for debts in jest yet there would be nothing to wonder at if he took offence at that way of putting it </s>
<s> but suppose you wrote long observation of your career as pickpocket and burglar has convinced me that my one lingering hope for recovering that sovereign lent you is to say pay up or i'll summons yer he would indeed be matter of fact friend if he took that as seriously meant </s>
<s> my eighth rule </s>
<s> when you say in your letter enclose cheque for or enclose john's letter for you to see leave off writing for moment go and get the document referred to and put it into the envelope </s>
<s> otherwise you are pretty certain to find it lying about after the post has gone </s>
<s> my ninth rule </s>
<s> when you get to the end of note sheet and find you have more to say take another piece of paper whole sheet or scrap as the case may demand but whatever you do don't cross </s>
<s> remember the old proverb cross writing makes cross reading </s>
<s> the old proverb you say enquiringly </s>
<s> how old well not so very ancient must confess </s>
<s> in fact i'm afraid invented it while writing this paragraph </s>
<s> still you know old is comparative term </s>
<s> think you would be quite justified in addressing chicken just out of the shell as old boy when compared with another chicken that was only half out </s>
<s> </s>
<s> how to end letter if doubtful whether to end with yours faithfully or yours truly or yours most truly </s>
<s> there are at least dozen varieties before you reach yours affectionately refer to your correspondent's last letter and make your winding up at least as friendly as his in fact even if shade more friendly it will do no harm </s>
<s> postscript is very useful invention but it is not meant as so many ladies suppose to contain the real gist of the letter it serves rather to throw into the shade any little matter we do not wish to make fuss about </s>
<s> for example your friend had promised to execute commission for you in town but forgot it thereby putting you to great inconvenience and he now writes to apologize for his negligence </s>
<s> it would be cruel and needlessly crushing to make it the main subject of your reply </s>
<s> how much more gracefully it comes in thus </s>
<s> ps don't distress yourself any more about having omitted that little matter in town </s>
<s> won't deny that it did put my plans out little at the time but it's all right now </s>
<s> often forget things myself and those who live in glass houses mustn't throw stones you know when you take your letters to the post carry them in your hand </s>
<s> if you put them in your pocket you will take long country walk speak from experience passing the post office twice going and returning and when you get home will find them still in your pocket </s>

<s> on registering correspondence let me recommend you to keep record of letters received and sent </s>
<s> have kept one for many years and have found it of the greatest possible service in many ways it secures my answering letters however long they have to wait it enables me to refer for my own guidance to the details of previous correspondence though the actual letters may have been destroyed long ago and most valuable feature of all if any difficulty arises years afterwards in connection with half forgotten correspondence it enables me to say with confidence did not tell you that he was an invaluable servant in every way and that you couldn't trust him too much </s>
<s> have pr cis of my letter </s>
<s> what said was he is valuable servant in many ways but don't trust him too much </s>
<s> so if he's cheated you you really must not hold me responsible for it will now give you few simple rules for making and keeping letter register </s>
<s> get blank book containing say leaves about inches wide and high </s>
<s> it should be well fastened into its cover as it will have to be opened and shut hundreds of times </s>
<s> have line ruled in red ink down each margin of every page an inch off the edge the margin should be wide enough to contain number of digits easily manage with inch margin but unless you write very small you will find an inch more comfortable </s>
<s> write pr cis of each letter received or sent in chronological order </s>
<s> let the entry of received letter reach from the left hand edge to the right hand marginal line and the entry of sent letter from the left hand marginal line to the right hand edge </s>
<s> thus the two kinds will be quite distinct and you can easily hunt through the received letters by themselves without being bothered with the sent letters and vice vers </s>
<s> use the right hand pages only and when you come to the end of the book turn it upside down and begin at the other end still using right hand pages </s>
<s> you will find this much more comfortable than using left hand pages </s>
<s> you will find it convenient to write at the top of every sheet of received letter its register number in full </s>
<s> will now give few ideal specimen pages of my letter register and make few remarks on them after which think you will find it easy enough to manage one for yourself </s>

<s> </s>
<s> do not keep this up to date but leave it till there are or pages to be done </s>
<s> work back till come among entries that are all supplied with foot references when once more glance through the last few pages to see if there are any entries not yet supplied with head references their predecessors may need special search </s>
<s> if an entry is connected in subject with another under different name link them by cross references distinguished from the head and foot references by being written further from the marginal line see no </s>

<s> do not keep this anything like up to date but leave it till there are or pages to look through at time </s>

<s> draper london chatto windus all rights reserved note the history of this little sparkle from the pen of lewis carroll may soon be told </s>
<s> it was in october of the year that he came on visit to certain vicarage in derbyshire where he had promised on the score of friendship to do what was for him most unusual favour to give lecture before public audience the writer well remembers his nervous highly strung manner as he stood before the little room full of simple people few of whom had any idea of the world wide reputation of that shy slight figure before them when the lecture was over he handed the manuscript to me saying do what you like with it the one for whose sake he did this kindness was not long after called into the silent land so the beautifully written ms in his customary violet ink has been treasured for more than twenty years only now and then being read over at christmastime to friend or two by the study fire always to meet with the same welcome and glad acknowledgment that here was genuine though little flame that could not have belonged to any other source but that which all the world knew in alice in wonderland and through the looking glass </s>
<s> there may be perhaps many others who gathering round winter fire will be glad to read words however few from that bright source and whose memories will respond to the fresh touch of that cherished name it remains to add but one or two more associations that cling to it and make the remembrance more vivid still </s>
<s> while lewis carroll was staying in the house there came to call certain genial and by no means shy dean who without realizing what he was doing proceeded in the presence of other callers to make some remark identifying mr dodgson as the author of his books there followed an immense explosion immediately on the visitor's departure with pathetic and serious request that if there were any risk of repetition of the call due warning might be given and the retreat secured probably not many readers of the immortal alice have ever seen the curious little whimsical paper called eight or nine wise words about letter writing which their author had printed and used to send to his acquaintance accompanied by small case for postage stamps it consists of forty pages and is published by emberlin and son oxford and these are the contents page on stamp cases how to begin letter how to go on with letter how to end letter on registering correspondence in this little script also there are the same sparkles of wit which betoken that nimble pen as for example under how to begin letter and never never dear madam this remark is addressed to ladies only </s>
<s> no man would ever do such thing put wednesday simply as the date </s>
<s> that way madness lies from section how to go on with letter great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly </s>
<s> of course you reply do it to save time very good object no doubt but what right have you to do it at your friend's expense </s>
<s> isn't his time as valuable as yours </s>
<s> years ago used to receive letters from friend and very interesting letters too written in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented </s>
<s> it generally took me about week to read one of his letters </s>
<s> used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure times to puzzle over the riddles which composed it holding it in different positions and at different distances till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me when at once wrote down the english under it </s>
<s> and when several had been thus guessed the context would help one with the others till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was deciphered </s>
<s> if all one's friends wrote like that life would be entirely spent in reading their letters rule for correspondence that has unfortunately become controversial </s>
<s> don't repeat yourself when once you have had your say fully and clearly on certain point and have failed to convince your friend drop that subject </s>
<s> to repeat your arguments all over again will simply lead to his doing the same and so you will go on like circulating decimal </s>
<s> did you ever know circulating decimal come to an end rule if your friend makes severe remark either leave it unnoticed or make your reply distinctly less severe and if he makes friendly remark tending towards making up the little difference that has arisen between you let your reply be distinctly more friendly </s>
<s> if in picking quarrel each party declined to go more than three eighths of the way and if in making friends each was ready to go five eighths of the way why there would be more reconciliations than quarrels </s>
<s> which is like the irishman's remonstrance to his gad about daughter shure you're always goin out </s>
<s> you go out three times for wanst that you come in rule don't try to get the last word </s>
<s> if you are gentleman and your friend lady this rule is superfluous you won't get the last word let the last word to day be part of another rule which gives glimpse into that gentle heart when you have written letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself put it aside till the next day </s>
<s> then read it over again and fancy it addressed to yourself </s>
<s> this will often lead to your writing it all over again taking out lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey instead and thus making much more palatable dish of it quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus tam cari capitis </s>

<s> november feeding the mind breakfast dinner tea in extreme cases breakfast luncheon dinner tea supper and glass of something hot at bedtime </s>
<s> what care we take about feeding the lucky body </s>
<s> which of us does as much for his mind </s>
<s> and what causes the difference </s>
<s> is the body so much the more important of the two </s>
<s> by no means but life depends on the body being fed whereas we can continue to exist as animals scarcely as men though the mind be utterly starved and neglected </s>
<s> therefore nature provides that in case of serious neglect of the body such terrible consequences of discomfort and pain shall ensue as will soon bring us back to sense of our duty and some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether leaving us no choice in the matter </s>
<s> it would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation </s>
<s> bless me one would cry forgot to wind up my heart this morning </s>
<s> to think that it has been standing still for the last three hours can't walk with you this afternoon friend would say as have no less than eleven dinners to digest </s>
<s> had to let them stand over from last week being so busy and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences if wait any longer well it is say for us that the consequences of neglecting the body can be clearly seen and felt and it might be well for some if the mind were equally visible and tangible if we could take it say to the doctor and have its pulse felt </s>
<s> why what have you been doing with this mind lately </s>
<s> how have you fed it </s>
<s> it looks pale and the pulse is very slow well doctor it has not had much regular food lately </s>
<s> gave it lot of sugar plums yesterday sugar plums </s>
<s> what kind well they were parcel of conundrums sir ah thought so </s>
<s> now just mind this if you go on playing tricks like that you'll spoil all its teeth and get laid up with mental indigestion </s>
<s> you must have nothing but the plainest reading for the next few days </s>
<s> take care now </s>
<s> no novels on any account considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in feeding and dosing the body it would think be quite worth our while to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the mind </s>
<s> first then we should set ourselves to provide for our mind its proper kind of food </s>
<s> we very soon learn what will and what will not agree with the body and find little difficulty in refusing piece of the tempting pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack of indigestion and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and magnesia but it takes great many lessons to convince us how indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are and again and again we make meal of the unwholesome novel sure to be followed by its usual train of low spirits unwillingness to work weariness of existence in fact by mental nightmare </s>
<s> then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in proper amount </s>
<s> mental gluttony or over reading is dangerous propensity tending to weakness of digestive power and in some cases to loss of appetite we know that bread is good and wholesome food but who would like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at sitting </s>
<s> have heard physician telling his patient whose complaint was merely gluttony and want of exercise that the earliest symptom of hyper nutrition is deposition of adipose tissue and no doubt the fine long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of fat </s>
<s> wonder if there is such thing in nature as fat mind </s>
<s> really think have met with one or two minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation could not jump over logical fence to save their lives always got stuck fast in narrow argument and in short were fit for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world </s>
<s> then again though the food be wholesome and in proper amount we know that we must not consume too many kinds at once </s>
<s> take the thirsty quart of beer or quart of cider or even quart of cold tea and he will probably thank you though not so heartily in the last case </s>
<s> but what think you his feelings would be if you offered him tray containing little mug of beer little mug of cider another of cold tea one of hot tea one of coffee one of cocoa and corresponding vessels of milk water brandy and water and butter milk </s>
<s> the sum total might be quart but would it be the same thing to the haymaker </s>
<s> having settled the proper kind amount and variety of our mental food it remains that we should be careful to allow proper intervals between meal and meal and not swallow the food hastily without mastication so that it may be thoroughly digested both which rules for the body are also applicable at once to the mind </s>
<s> first as to the intervals these are as really necessary as they are for the body with this difference only that while the body requires three or four hours rest before it is ready for another meal the mind will in many cases do with three or four minutes </s>
<s> believe that the interval required is much shorter than is generally supposed and from personal experience would recommend anyone who has to devote several hours together to one subject of thought to try the effect of such break say once an hour leaving off for five minutes only each time but taking care to throw the mind absolutely out of gear for those five minutes and to turn it entirely to other subjects </s>
<s> it is astonishing what an amount of impetus and elasticity the mind recovers during those short periods of rest </s>
<s> and then as to the mastication of the food the mental process answering to this is simply thinking over what we read </s>
<s> this is very much greater exertion of mind than the mere passive taking in the contents of our author </s>
<s> so much greater an exertion is it that as coleridge says the mind often angrily refuses to put itself to such trouble so much greater that we are far too apt to neglect it altogether and go on pouring in fresh food on the top of the undigested masses already lying there till the unfortunate mind is fairly swamped under the flood </s>
<s> but the greater the exertion the more valuable we may be sure is the effect </s>
<s> one hour of steady thinking over subject solitary walk is as good an opportunity for the process as any other is worth two or three of reading only </s>
<s> and just consider another effect of this thorough digestion of the books we read mean the arranging and ticketing so to speak of the subjects in our minds so that we can readily refer to them when we want them </s>
<s> sam slick tells us that he has learnt several languages in his life but somehow couldn't keep the parcels sorted in his mind </s>
<s> and many mind that hurries through book after book without waiting to digest or arrange anything gets into that sort of condition and the unfortunate owner finds himself far from fit really to support the character all his friends give him </s>
<s> thoroughly well read man </s>
<s> just you try him in any subject now </s>
<s> you can't puzzle him you turn to the thoroughly well read man </s>
<s> you ask him question say in english history he is understood to have just finished reading macaulay </s>
<s> he smiles good naturedly tries to look as if he knew all about it and proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer </s>
<s> up comes handful of very promising facts but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong century and are pitched in again </s>
<s> second haul brings up fact much more like the real thing but unfortunately along with it comes tangle of other things fact in political economy rule in arithmetic the ages of his brother's children and stanza of gray's elegy and among all these the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled </s>
<s> meanwhile every one is waiting for his reply and as the silence is getting more and more awkward our well read friend has to stammer out some half answer at last not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an ordinary schoolboy would have given </s>
<s> and all this for want of making up his knowledge into proper bundles and ticketing them </s>
<s> do you know the unfortunate victim of ill judged mental feeding when you see him </s>
<s> can you doubt him </s>
<s> look at him drearily wandering round reading room tasting dish after dish we beg his pardon book after book keeping to none </s>
<s> first mouthful of novel but no faugh </s>
<s> he has had nothing but that to eat for the last week and is quite tired of the taste </s>
<s> then slice of science but you know at once what the result of that will be ah of course much too tough for his teeth </s>
<s> and so on through the whole weary round which he tried and failed in yesterday and will probably try and fail in to morrow </s>
<s> mr oliver wendell holmes in his very amusing book the professor at the breakfast table gives the following rule for knowing whether human being is young or old the crucial experiment is this offer bulky bun to the suspected individual just ten minutes before dinner </s>
<s> if this is easily accepted and devoured the fact of youth is established he tells us that human being if young will eat anything at any hour of the day or night to ascertain the healthiness of the mental appetite of human animal place in its hands short well written but not exciting treatise on some popular subject mental bun in fact </s>
<s> if it is read with eager interest and perfect attention and if the reader can answer questions on the subject afterwards the mind is in first rate working order </s>
<s> if it be politely laid down again or perhaps lounged over for few minutes and then can't read this stupid book </s>
<s> would you hand me the second volume of the mysterious murder you may be equally sure that there is something wrong in the mental digestion </s>

<s> only he thinks it affects the weather </s>

<s> the professor was back in moment he had changed his dressing gown for frock coat and had put on pair of very strange looking boots the tops of which were open umbrellas </s>

<s> these are the boots for horizontal weather image boots for horizontal weather but what's the use of wearing umbrellas round one's knees in ordinary rain the professor admitted they would not be of much use </s>

<s> she is the heroine </s>
<s> and am one of those subordinate characters that only turn up when needed for the development of her destiny and whose final appearance is outside the church waiting to greet the happy pair yes my lady change at fayfield were the next words heard oh that too obsequious guard next station but one and the door closed and the lady settled down into her corner and the monotonous throb of the engine making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster whose very circulation we could feel proclaimed that we were once more speeding on our way </s>
<s> the lady had perfectly formed nose caught myself saying to myself hazel eyes and lips and here it occurred to me that to see for myself what the lady was really like would be more satisfactory than much speculation </s>
<s> looked round cautiously and was entirely disappointed of my hope </s>
<s> the veil which shrouded her whole face was too thick for me to see more than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what might be lovely oval face but might also unfortunately be an equally unlovely one </s>
<s> closed my eyes again saying to myself couldn't have better chance for an experiment in telepathy </s>
<s> i'll think out her face and afterwards test the portrait with the original at first no result at all crowned my efforts though divided my swift mind now hither now thither in way that felt sure would have made aeneas green with envy but the dimly seen oval remained as provokingly blank as ever mere ellipse as if in some mathematical diagram without even the foci that might be made to do duty as nose and mouth </s>
<s> gradually however the conviction came upon me that could by certain concentration of thought think the veil away and so get glimpse of the mysterious face as to which the two questions is she pretty and is she plain still hung suspended in my mind in beautiful equipoise </s>
<s> success was partial and fitful still there was result ever and anon the veil seemed to vanish in sudden flash of light but before could fully realise the face all was dark again </s>
<s> in each such glimpse the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent and when had at last thought the veil entirely away it was unmistakeably the sweet face of little sylvie </s>
<s> so either i've been dreaming about sylvie said to myself and this is the reality </s>
<s> or else i've really been with sylvie and this is dream </s>
<s> is life itself dream wonder to occupy the time got out the letter which had caused me to take this sudden railway journey from my london home down to strange fishing town on the north coast and read it over again dear old friend i'm sure it will be as great pleasure to me as it can possibly be to you to meet once more after so many years and of course shall be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as have only you know one mustn't violate professional etiquette </s>

<s> do you believe in fate the fair incognita turned her head quickly at the sudden question </s>
<s> no don't she said with smile </s>
<s> do you didn't mean to ask the question stammered little taken aback at having begun conversation in so unconventional fashion </s>
<s> the lady's smile became laugh not mocking laugh but the laugh of happy child who is perfectly at her ease </s>
<s> didn't you she said </s>
<s> then it was case of what you doctors call unconscious cerebration am no doctor replied </s>
<s> do look so like one </s>
<s> or what makes you think it she pointed to the book had been reading which was so lying that its title diseases of the heart was plainly visible </s>
<s> one needn't be doctor said to take an interest in medical books </s>
<s> there's another class of readers who are yet more deeply interested you mean the patients she interrupted while look of tender pity gave new sweetness to her face </s>
<s> but with an evident wish to avoid possibly painful topic one needn't be either to take an interest in books of science </s>
<s> which contain the greatest amount of science do you think the books or the minds rather profound question for lady said to myself holding with the conceit so natural to man that woman's intellect is essentially shallow </s>
<s> and considered minute before replying </s>
<s> if you mean living minds don't think it's possible to decide </s>
<s> there is so much written science that no living person has ever read and there is so much thought out science that hasn't yet been written </s>
<s> but if you mean the whole human race then think the minds have it everything recorded in books must have once been in some mind you know isn't that rather like one of the rules in algebra my lady enquired </s>
<s> algebra too thought with increasing wonder mean if we consider thoughts as factors may we not say that the least common multiple of all the minds contains that of all the books but not the other way certainly we may replied delighted with the illustration </s>
<s> and what grand thing it would be went on dreamily thinking aloud rather than talking if we could only apply that rule to books </s>
<s> you know in finding the least common multiple we strike out quantity wherever it occurs except in the term where it is raised to its highest power </s>
<s> so we should have to erase every recorded thought except in the sentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity my lady laughed merrily </s>
<s> some books would be reduced to blank paper i'm afraid she said </s>
<s> they would </s>
<s> most libraries would be terribly diminished in bulk </s>
<s> but just think what they would gain in quality when will it be done she eagerly asked </s>

<s> begin again as was remarking chanted the obedient lord chancellor this portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions of revolution and what are the dimensions of revolution the voice was genial and mellow and the face of the tall dignified old man who had just entered the room leading sylvie by the hand and with bruno riding triumphantly on his shoulder was too noble and gentle to have scared less guilty man but the lord chancellor turned pale instantly and could hardly articulate the words the dimensions your your high excellency </s>
<s> scarcely comprehend well the length breadth and thickness if you like it better and the old man smiled half contemptuously </s>
<s> the lord chancellor recovered himself with great effort and pointed to the open window </s>
<s> if your high excellency will listen for moment to the shouts of the exasperated populace of the exasperated populace the sub warden repeated in louder tone as the lord chancellor being in state of abject terror had dropped almost into whisper you will understand what it is they want </s>
<s> and at that moment there surged into the room hoarse confused cry in which the only clearly audible words were less bread more taxes the old man laughed heartily </s>
<s> what in the world he was beginning but the chancellor heard him not </s>
<s> some mistake he muttered hurrying to the window from which he shortly returned with an air of relief </s>
<s> now listen he exclaimed holding up his hand impressively </s>
<s> and now the words came quite distinctly and with the regularity of the ticking of clock more bread less taxes more bread the warden repeated in astonishment </s>
<s> why the new government bakery was opened only last week and gave orders to sell the bread at cost price during the present scarcity </s>
<s> what can they expect more the bakery's closed y'reince the chancellor said more loudly and clearly than he had spoken yet </s>
<s> he was emboldened by the consciousness that here at least he had evidence to produce and he placed in the warden's hands few printed notices that were lying ready with some open ledgers on side table </s>
<s> yes yes see the warden muttered glancing carelessly through them </s>

<s> bruno began feeling in his pockets looking more and more melancholy as he did so then he put his thumb in his mouth and considered for minute then he quietly left the room </s>
<s> he had hardly done so before the professor was back again quite out of breath </s>
<s> wishing you many happy returns of the day my dear child he went on addressing the smiling little girl who had run to meet him </s>
<s> allow me to give you birthday present </s>
<s> it's second hand pincushion my dear </s>
<s> and it only cost fourpence halfpenny thank you it's very pretty and sylvie rewarded the old man with hearty kiss </s>
<s> and the pins they gave me for nothing the professor added in high glee </s>
<s> fifteen of em and only one bent i'll make the bent one into hook said sylvie </s>
<s> to catch bruno with when he runs away from his lessons you ca'n guess what my present is said uggug who had taken the butter dish from the table and was standing behind her with wicked leer on his face </s>

<s> it's this cried the bad boy exultingly as he emptied the dish over her and then with grin of delight at his own cleverness looked round for applause </s>
<s> sylvie coloured crimson as she shook off the butter from her frock but she kept her lips tight shut and walked away to the window where she stood looking out and trying to recover her temper </s>
<s> uggug's triumph was very short one the sub warden had returned just in time to be witness of his dear child's playfulness and in another moment skilfully applied box on the ear had changed the grin of delight into howl of pain </s>

<s> and instead of being pleased with the compliment the spiteful little thing has gone away in huff the sub warden was very good hand at changing subject </s>

<s> go away dears he said </s>
<s> there's business to talk over </s>
<s> sylvie and bruno went away hand in hand but on reaching the door sylvie came back again and went up to uggug timidly </s>
<s> don't mind about the butter she said and i'm sorry he hurt you and she tried to shake hands with the little ruffian but uggug only blubbered louder and wouldn't make friends </s>

<s> his wife was still leaning out of the window and kept repeating ca'n see that pig </s>
<s> where is it it's moved to the right now it's gone little to the left said the sub warden but he had his back to the window and was making signals to the lord chancellor pointing to uggug and the door with many cunning nod and wink </s>
<s> image removal of uggug the chancellor caught his meaning at last and crossing the room took that interesting child by the ear the next moment he and uggug were out of the room and the door shut behind them but not before one piercing yell had rung through the room and reached the ears of the fond mother </s>

<s> it's some hyaena or other replied the sub warden looking vaguely up to the ceiling as if that was where they usually were to be found </s>
<s> let us to business my dear </s>

<s> cunning conspiracy </s>
<s> the warden entered at this moment and close behind him came the lord chancellor little flushed and out of breath and adjusting his wig which appeared to have been dragged partly off his head </s>
<s> but where is my precious child my lady enquired as the four took their seats at the small side table devoted to ledgers and bundles and bills </s>
<s> he left the room few minutes ago with the lord chancellor the sub warden briefly explained </s>
<s> ah said my lady graciously smiling on that high official </s>
<s> your lordship has very taking way with children </s>
<s> doubt if any one could gain the ear of my darling uggug so quickly as you can for an entirely stupid woman my lady's remarks were curiously full of meaning of which she herself was wholly unconscious </s>
<s> the chancellor bowed but with very uneasy air </s>
<s> think the warden was about to speak he remarked evidently anxious to change the subject </s>
<s> but my lady would not be checked </s>
<s> he is clever boy she continued with enthusiasm but he needs man like your lordship to draw him out the chancellor bit his lip and was silent </s>
<s> he evidently feared that stupid as she looked she understood what she said this time and was having joke at his expense </s>
<s> he might have spared himself all anxiety whatever accidental meaning her words might have she herself never meant anything at all </s>
<s> it is all settled the warden announced wasting no time over preliminaries </s>
<s> the sub wardenship is abolished and my brother is appointed to act as vice warden whenever am absent </s>
<s> so as am going abroad for while he will enter on his new duties at once and there will really be vice after all my lady enquired </s>
<s> hope so the warden smilingly replied </s>
<s> my lady looked much pleased and tried to clap her hands but you might as well have knocked two feather beds together for any noise it made </s>
<s> when my husband is vice she said it will be the same as if we had hundred vices hear hear cried the sub warden </s>
<s> you seem to think it very remarkable my lady remarked with some severity that your wife should speak the truth no not remarkable at all her husband anxiously explained </s>
<s> nothing is remarkable that you say sweet one my lady smiled approval of the sentiment and went on </s>
<s> and am vice wardeness if you choose to use that title said the warden but your excellency will be the proper style of address </s>
<s> and trust that both his excellency and her excellency will observe the agreement have drawn up </s>
<s> the provision am most anxious about is this he unrolled large parchment scroll and read aloud the words item that we will be kind to the poor the chancellor worded it for me he added glancing at that great functionary </s>

<s> he was nervously rolling and unrolling several other scrolls and making room among them for the one the warden had just handed to him </s>
<s> these are merely the rough copies he explained and as soon as have put in the final corrections making great commotion among the different parchments semi colon or two that have accidentally omitted here he darted about pen in hand from one part of the scroll to another spreading sheets of blotting paper over his corrections all will be ready for signing should it not be read out first my lady enquired </s>
<s> no need no need the sub warden and the chancellor exclaimed at the same moment with feverish eagerness </s>
<s> no need at all the warden gently assented </s>

<s> it provides that he shall exercise the full authority of warden and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue attached to the office until my return or failing that until bruno comes of age and that he shall then hand over to myself or to bruno as the case may be the wardenship the unspent revenue and the contents of the treasury which are to be preserved intact under his guardianship all this time the sub warden was busy with the chancellor's help shifting the papers from side to side and pointing out to the warden the place whew he was to sign </s>
<s> he then signed it himself and my lady and the chancellor added their names as witnesses </s>
<s> short partings are best said the warden </s>
<s> all is ready for my journey </s>
<s> my children are waiting below to see me off he gravely kissed my lady shook hands with his brother and the chancellor and left the room </s>
<s> image what game the three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the warden was out of hearing then to my surprise they broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter </s>
<s> what game oh what game cried the chancellor </s>
<s> and he and the vice warden joined hands and skipped wildly about the room </s>
<s> my lady was too dignified to skip but she laughed like the neighing of horse and waved her handkerchief above her head it was clear to her very limited understanding that something very clever had been done but what it was she had yet to learn </s>
<s> you said should hear all about it when the warden had gone she remarked as soon as she could make herself heard </s>
<s> and so you shall tabby her husband graciously replied as he removed the blotting paper and showed the two parchments lying side by side </s>
<s> this is the one he read but didn't sign and this is the one he signed but didn't read </s>
<s> you see it was all covered up except the place for signing the names yes yes my lady interrupted eagerly and began comparing the two agreements </s>
<s> item that he shall exercise the authority of warden in the warden's absence why that's been changed into shall be absolute governor for life with the title of emperor if elected to that office by the people what </s>
<s> are you emperor darling not yet dear the vice warden replied </s>
<s> it won't do to let this paper be seen just at present </s>
<s> all in good time my lady nodded and read on </s>
<s> item that we will be kind to the poor why that's omitted altogether course it is said her husband </s>
<s> we're not going to bother about the wretches good said my lady with emphasis and read on again </s>
<s> item that the contents of the treasury be preserved intact why that's altered into shall be at the absolute disposal of the vice warden </s>
<s> well sibby that was clever trick </s>
<s> all the jewels only think </s>
<s> may go and put them on directly well not just yet lovey her husband uneasily replied </s>
<s> you see the public mind isn't quite ripe for it yet </s>
<s> we must feel our way </s>
<s> of course we'll have the coach and four out at once </s>

<s> it'll do no harm and when will the conspiracy hist her husband hastily interrupted her as the door opened and sylvie and bruno came in with their arms twined lovingly round each other bruno sobbing convulsively with his face hidden on his sister's shoulder and sylvie more grave and quiet but with tears streaming down her cheeks </s>

<s> eat and don't cry were her short and simple orders and the poor children sat down side by side but seemed in no mood for eating </s>
<s> for the second time the door opened or rather was burst open this time as uggug rushed violently into the room shouting that old beggars come again he's not to have any food the vice warden was beginning but the chancellor interrupted him </s>
<s> it's all right he said in low voice the servants have their orders he's just under here said uggug who had gone to the window and was looking down into the court yard </s>
<s> where my darling said his fond mother flinging her arms round the neck of the little monster </s>
<s> all of us except sylvie and bruno who took no notice of what was going on followed her to the window </s>
<s> the old beggar looked up at us with hungry eyes </s>
<s> only crust of bread your highness he pleaded </s>

<s> crust of bread is what crave he repeated </s>
<s> single crust and little water here's some water drink this uggug bellowed emptying jug of water over his head </s>
<s> well done my boy cried the vice warden </s>
<s> that's the way to settle such folk clever boy the wardeness chimed in </s>
<s> hasn't he good spirits take stick to him shouted the vice warden as the old beggar shook the water from his ragged cloak and again gazed meekly upwards </s>
<s> take red hot poker to him my lady again chimed in </s>
<s> possibly there was no red hot poker handy but some sticks were forthcoming in moment and threatening faces surrounded the poor old wanderer who waved them back with quiet dignity </s>
<s> no need to break my old bones he said </s>
<s> am going </s>
<s> not even crust poor poor old man exclaimed little voice at my side half choked with sobs </s>
<s> bruno was at the window trying to throw out his slice of plum cake but sylvie held him back </s>

<s> yes yes darling sylvie gently pleaded </s>

<s> he's gone away don't you see </s>
<s> let's go after him and she led him out of the room unnoticed by the rest of the party who were wholly absorbed in watching the old beggar </s>
<s> the conspirators returned to their seats and continued their conversation in an undertone so as not to be heard by uggug who was still standing at the window </s>
<s> by the way there was something about bruno succeeding to the wrardenship said my lady </s>
<s> how does that stand in the new agreement the chancellor chuckled </s>
<s> just the same word for word he said with one exception my lady </s>
<s> instead of bruno i've taken the liberty to put in he dropped his voice to whisper to put in uggug you know uggug indeed exclaimed in burst of indignation could no longer control </s>
<s> to bring out even that one word seemed gigantic effort but the cry once uttered all effort ceased at once sudden gust swept away the whole scene and found myself sitting up staring at the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage who had now thrown back her veil and was looking at me with an expression of amused surprise </s>

<s> was dreaming you said uggug indeed the young lady replied with quivering lips that would curve themselves into smile in spite of all her efforts to look grave </s>
<s> at least you didn't say it you shouted it i'm very sorry was all could say feeling very penitent and helpless </s>

<s> her friendliness and utter unreserve took me aback for moment yet there was no touch of forwardness or boldness about the child for child almost she seemed to be guessed her at scarcely over twenty all was the innocent frankness of some angelic visitant new to the ways of earth and the conventionalisms or if you will the barbarisms of society </s>

<s> and they never do any midnight murders </s>
<s> they couldn't welter in gore to save their lives weltering in gore is very expressive phrase certainly </s>
<s> can it be done in any fluid wonder think not the lady readily replied quite as if she had thought it out long ago </s>
<s> it has to be something thick </s>
<s> for instance you might welter in bread sauce </s>
<s> that being white would be more suitable for ghost supposing it wished to welter you have real good terrifying ghost in that book hinted </s>

<s> what lovely garden you've made </s>
<s> do you know i'd like to live here always in the winter nights the gardener was beginning </s>
<s> but i'd nearly forgotten what we came about sylvie interrupted </s>
<s> would you please let us through into the road </s>
<s> there's poor old beggar just gone out and he's very hungry and bruno wants to give him his cake you know it's as much as my place is worth the gardener muttered taking key from his pocket and beginning to unlock door in the garden wall </s>

<s> bruno innocently enquired </s>
<s> but the gardener only grinned </s>
<s> that's secret he said </s>
<s> mind you come back quick he called after the children as they passed out into the road </s>

<s> the old beggar must have been very deaf as he paid no attention whatever to bruno's eager shouting but trudged wearily on never pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of cake </s>
<s> the poor little fellow was quite out of breath and could only utter the one word cake not with the gloomy decision with which her excellency had so lately pronounced it but with sweet childish timidity looking up into the old man's face with eyes that loved all things both great and small the old man snatched it from him and devoured it greedily as some hungry wild beast might have done but never word of thanks did he give his little benefactor only growled more more and glared at the half frightened children </s>
<s> there is no more sylvie said with tears in her eyes </s>
<s> i'd eaten mine </s>
<s> it was shame to let you be turned away like that </s>
<s> i'm very sorry lost the rest of the sentence for my mind had recurred with great shock of surprise to lady muriel orme who had so lately uttered these very words of sylvie's yes and in sylvie's own voice and with sylvie's gentle pleading eyes </s>

<s> at another time might have doubted the evidence of my eyes or at least have felt some astonishment but in this strange scene my whole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen next </s>
<s> when the bush had sunk quite out of our sight marble steps were seen leading downwards into darkness </s>
<s> the old man led the way and we eagerly followed </s>
<s> the staircase was so dark at first that could only just see the forms of the children as hand in hand they groped their way down after their guide but it got lighter every moment with strange silvery brightness that seemed to exist in the air as there were no lamps visible and when at last we reached level floor the room in which we found ourselves was almost as light as day </s>
<s> it was eight sided having in each angle slender pillar round which silken draperies were twined </s>
<s> the wall between the pillars was entirely covered to the height of six or seven feet with creepers from which hung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers that almost hid the leaves </s>

<s> just thousand miles sweet one since the gardener unlocked that door for you thousand miles bruno repeated </s>
<s> and may eat one eat mile little rogue no said bruno </s>
<s> mean may eat one of that fruits yes child said his father and then you'll find out what pleasure is like the pleasure we all seek so madly and enjoy so mournfully bruno ran eagerly to the wall and picked fruit that was shaped something like banana but had the colour of strawberry </s>
<s> he ate it with beaming looks that became gradually more gloomy and were very blank indeed by the time he had finished </s>
<s> it hasn't got no taste at all he complained </s>
<s> couldn't feel nuffin in my mouf </s>

<s> are they all like that father they're all like that to you darling because you don't belong to elfland yet </s>
<s> but to me they are real bruno looked puzzled </s>
<s> i'll try anuvver kind of fruits he said and jumped down off the king's knee </s>
<s> there's some lovely striped ones just like rainbow and off he ran </s>

<s> tried to pick so me myself but it was like grasping air and soon gave up the attempt and returned to sylvie </s>
<s> look well at it my darling the old man was saying and tell me how you like it it's just lovely cried sylvie delightedly </s>
<s> bruno come and look and she held up so that he might see the light through it heart shaped locket apparently cut out of single jewel of rich blue colour with slender gold chain attached to it </s>

<s> all will love sylvie he made them out at last </s>
<s> and so they doos he cried clasping his arms round her neck </s>
<s> everybody loves sylvie but we love her best don't we bruno said the old king as he took possession of the locket </s>
<s> now sylvie look at this and he showed her lying on the palm of his hand locket of deep crimson colour the same shape as the blue one and like it attached to slender golden chain </s>
<s> lovelier and lovelier exclaimed sylvie clasping her hands in ecstasy </s>
<s> look bruno and there's words on this one too said bruno </s>
<s> sylvie will love all now you see the difference said the old man different colours and different words </s>
<s> choose one of them darling </s>
<s> i'll give you which ever you like best image the crimson locket sylvie whispered the words several times over with thoughtful smile and then made her decision </s>
<s> it's very nice to be loved she said but it's nicer to love other people </s>
<s> may have the red one father the old man said nothing but could see his eyes fill with tears as he bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in long loving kiss </s>

<s> why don't you see </s>

<s> quite so your excellency the baron was saying as we entered the library </s>
<s> all the infantry were under my command he turned and was duly presented to my lady </s>
<s> military hero said my lady </s>
<s> the fat little man simpered </s>
<s> well yes he replied modestly casting down his eyes </s>
<s> my ancestors were all famous for military genius my lady smiled graciously </s>
<s> it often runs in families she remarked just as love for pastry does the baron looked slightly offended and the vice warden discreetly changed the subject </s>
<s> dinner will soon be ready he said </s>
<s> may have the honour of conducting your adiposity to the guest chamber certainly certainly the baron eagerly assented </s>
<s> it would never do to keep dinner waiting and he almost trotted out of the room after the vice warden </s>
<s> he was back again so speedily that the vice warden had barely time to explain to my lady that her remark about love for pastry was unfortunate </s>
<s> you might have seen with half an eye he added that that's his line </s>
<s> military genius indeed </s>
<s> pooh dinner ready yet the baron enquired as he hurried into the room </s>
<s> will be in few minutes the vice warden replied </s>
<s> meanwhile let's take turn in the garden </s>
<s> you were telling me he continued as the trio left the house something about great battle in which you had the command of the infantry true said the baron </s>
<s> the enemy as was saying far outnumbered us but marched my men right into the middle of what's that the military hero exclaimed in agitated tones drawing back behind the vice warden as strange creature rushed wildly upon them brandishing spade </s>
<s> it's only the gardener the vice warden replied in an encouraging tone </s>
<s> quite harmless assure you </s>
<s> hark he's singing </s>
<s> its his favorite amusement and once more those shrill discordant tones rang out he thought he saw banker's clerk descending from the bus he looked again and found it was hippopotamus if this should stay to dine he said there won't be mutch for us throwing away the spade he broke into frantic jig snapping his fingers and repeating again and again there won't be much for us </s>
<s> there won't be much for us image it was hippoptamus once more the baron looked slightly offended but the vice warden hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him and in fact had no meaning at all </s>
<s> you didn't mean anything by it now did you he appealed to the gardener who had finished his song and stood balancing himself on one leg and looking at them with his mouth open </s>
<s> never means nothing said the gardener and uggug luckily came up at the moment and gave the conversation new turn </s>
<s> allow me to present my son said the vice warden adding in whisper one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived </s>
<s> i'll contrive for you to see some of his cleverness </s>
<s> he knows everything that other boys don't know and in archery in fishing in painting and in music his skill is but you shall judge for yourself </s>
<s> you see that target over there </s>
<s> he shall shoot an arrow at it </s>
<s> dear boy he went on aloud his adiposity would like to see you shoot </s>
<s> bring his highness bow and arrows uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow and prepared to shoot </s>
<s> just as the arrow left the bow the vice warden trod heavily on the toe of the baron who yelled with the pain </s>
<s> ten thousand pardons </s>
<s> he exclaimed </s>
<s> stepped back in my excitement </s>
<s> see </s>
<s> it is bull's eye the baron gazed in astonishment </s>
<s> he held the bow so awkwardly it seemed impossible he muttered </s>
<s> but there was no room for doubt there was the arrow right in the centre of the bull's eye </s>
<s> the lake is close by continued the vice warden </s>
<s> bring his highness fishing rod and uggug most unwillingly held the rod and dangled the fly over the water </s>
<s> beetle on your arm cried my lady pinching the poor baron's arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once </s>
<s> that kind is poisonous she explained </s>
<s> but what pity </s>
<s> you missed seeing the fish pulled out an enormous dead cod fish was lying on the bank with the hook in its mouth </s>
<s> had always fancied the baron faltered that cod were salt water fish not in this country said the vice warden </s>
<s> shall we go in </s>
<s> ask my son some question on the way any subject you like and the sulky boy was violently shoved forwards to walk at the baron's side </s>
<s> could your highness tell me the baron cautiously began how much seven times nine would come to turn to the left cried the vice warden hastily stepping forwards to show the way so hastily that he ran against his unfortunate guest who fell heavily on his face </s>
<s> so sorry my lady exclaimed as she and her husband helped him to his feet again </s>
<s> my son was in the act of saying sixty three as you fell the baron said nothing he was covered with dust and seemed much hurt both in body and mind </s>
<s> however when they had got him into the house and given him good brushing matters looked little better </s>
<s> dinner was served in due course and every fresh dish seemed to increase the good humour of the baron but all efforts to get him to express his opinion as to uggug's cleverness were in vain until that interesting youth had left the room and was seen from the open window prowling about the lawn with little basket which he was filling with frogs </s>
<s> so fond of natural history as he is dear boy said the doting mother </s>
<s> now do tell us baron what you think of him to be perfectly candid said the cautious baron would like little more evidence </s>
<s> think you mentioned his skill in music said the vice warden </s>
<s> why he's simply prodigy </s>
<s> you shall hear him play the piano </s>
<s> and he walked to the window </s>
<s> ug mean my boy </s>
<s> come in for minute and bring the music master with you </s>
<s> to turn over the music for him he added as an explanation </s>
<s> uggug having filled his basket with frogs had no objection to obey and soon appeared in the room followed by fierce looking little man who asked the vice warden vot music vill you haf the sonata that his highness plays so charmingly said the vice warden </s>
<s> his highness haf not the music master began but was sharply stopped by the vice warden </s>
<s> silence sir </s>
<s> go and turn over the music for his highness </s>
<s> my dear to the wardeness will you show him what to do </s>
<s> and meanwhile baron i'll just show you most interesting map we have of outland and fairyland and that sort of thing by the time my lady had returned from explaining things to the music master the map had been hung up and the baron was already much bewildered by the vice warden's habit of pointing to one place while he shouted out the name of another </s>
<s> image the map of fairyland my lady joining in pointing out other places and shouting other names only made matters worse and at last the baron in despair took to pointing out places for himself and feebly asked is that great yellow splotch fairyland yes that's fairyland said the vice warden and you might as well give him hint he muttered to my lady about going back to morrow </s>
<s> he eats like shark </s>
<s> it would hardly do for me to mention it his wife caught the idea and at once began giving hints of the most subtle and delicate kind </s>
<s> just see what short way it is back to fairyland </s>
<s> why if you started to morrow morning you'd get there in very little more than week the baron looked incredulous </s>
<s> it took me full month to come he said </s>
<s> but it's ever so much shorter going back you know the baron looked appealingly to the vice warden who chimed in readily </s>
<s> you can go back five times in the time it took you to come here once if you start to morrow morning all this time the sonata was pealing through the room </s>
<s> the baron could not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played but he tried in vain to get glimpse of the youthful performer </s>
<s> every time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him either the vice warden or his wife was sure to get in the way pointing out some new place on the map and deafening him with some new name </s>
<s> he gave in at last wished hasty good night and left the room while his host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph </s>
<s> deftly done cried the vice warden </s>
<s> craftily contrived </s>
<s> but what means all that tramping on the stairs he half opened the door looked out and added in tone of dismay the baron's boxes are being carried down and what means all that rumbling of wheels cried my lady </s>
<s> she peeped through the window curtains </s>
<s> the baron's carriage has come round she groaned </s>
<s> at this moment the door opened fat furious face looked in voice hoarse with passion thundered out the words my room is full of frogs leave you and the door closed again </s>
<s> and still the noble sonata went pealing through the room but it was arthur's masterly touch that roused the echoes and thrilled my very soul with the tender music of the immortal sonata pathetique and it was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy traveler could bring himself to utter the words good night and to seek his much needed pillow </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> ride on lion </s>
<s> the next day glided away pleasantly enough partly in settling myself in my new quarters and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood under arthur's guidance and trying to form general idea of elveston and its inhabitants </s>
<s> when five o'clock arrived arthur proposed without any embarrassment this time to take me with him up to the hall in order that might make acquaintance with the earl of ainslie who had taken it for the season and renew acquaintance with his daughter lady muriel </s>
<s> my first impressions of the gentle dignified and yet genial old man were entirely favourable and the real satisfaction that showed itself on his daughter's face as she met me with the words this is indeed an unlooked for pleasure was very soothing for whatever remains of personal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years and much buffeting with rough world had left in me </s>
<s> yet noted and was glad to note evidence of far deeper feeling than mere friendly regard in her meeting with arthur though this was as gathered an almost daily occurrence and the conversation between them in which the earl and were only occasional sharers had an ease and spontaneity rarely met with except between very old friends and as knew that they had not known each other for longer period than the summer which was now rounding into autumn felt certain that love and love alone could explain the phenomenon </s>
<s> how convenient it would be lady muriel laughingly remarked propos of my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying cup of tea across the room to the earl if cups of tea had no weight at all </s>
<s> then perhaps ladies would sometimes be permitted to carry them for short distances one can easily imagine situation said arthur where things would necessarily have no weight relatively to each other though each would have its usual weight looked at by itself some desperate paradox said the earl </s>
<s> tell us how it could be </s>
<s> we shall never guess it well suppose this house just as it is placed few billion miles above planet and with nothing else near enough to disturb it of course it falls to the planet the earl nodded </s>
<s> of course though it might take some centuries to do it and is five o'clock tea to be going on all the while said lady muriel </s>
<s> that and other things said arthur </s>
<s> the inhabitants would live their lives grow up and die and still the house would be falling falling falling </s>
<s> but now as to the relative weight of things </s>
<s> nothing can be heavy you know except by trying to fall and being prevented from doing so </s>
<s> you all grant that we all granted that </s>
<s> well now if take this book and hold it out at arm's length of course feel its weight </s>
<s> it is trying to fall and prevent it </s>
<s> and if let go it fails to the floor </s>
<s> but if we were all falling together it couldn't be trying to fall any quicker you know for if let go what more could it do than fall </s>
<s> and as my hand would be falling too at the same rate it would never leave it for that would be to get ahead of it in the race </s>
<s> and it could never overtake the failing floor see it clearly said lady muriel </s>
<s> but it makes one dizzy to think of such things </s>
<s> how can you make us do it there is more curious idea yet ventured to say </s>
<s> suppose cord fastened to the house from below and pulled down by some one on the planet </s>
<s> then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of falling but the furniture with our noble selves would go on failing at their old pace and would therefore be left behind practically we should rise to the ceiling said the earl </s>
<s> the inevitable result of which would be concussion of brain to avoid that said arthur let us have the furniture fixed to the floor and ourselves tied down to the furniture </s>
<s> then the five o'clock tea could go on in peace with one little drawback lady muriel gaily interrupted </s>
<s> we should take the cups down with us but what about the tea had forgotten the tea arthur confessed </s>
<s> that no doubt would rise to the ceiling unless you chose to drink it on the way which think is quite nonsense enough for one while said the earl </s>
<s> what news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of london this drew me into the conversation which now took more conventional tone </s>
<s> after while arthur gave the signal for our departure and in the cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach enjoying the silence broken only by the murmur of the sea and the far away music of some fishermen's song almost as much as our late pleasant talk </s>
<s> we sat down among the rocks by little pool so rich in animal vegetable and zoophytic or whatever is the right word life that became entranced in the study of it and when arthur proposed returning to our lodgings begged to be left there for while to watch and muse alone </s>
<s> the fishermen's song grew ever nearer and clearer as their boat stood in for the beach and would have gone down to see them land their cargo of fish had not the microcosm at my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly </s>
<s> one ancient crab that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to side of the pool had particularly fascinated me there was vacancy in its stare and an aimless violence in its behaviour that irresistibly recalled the gardener who had befriended sylvie and bruno and as gazed caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song </s>
<s> the silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of sylvie </s>
<s> would you please let us out into the road what </s>
<s> after that old beggar again the gardener yelled and began singing he thought he saw kangaroo that worked coffee mill he looked again and found it was vegetable pill were to swallow this he said should be very ill image he thought he saw kangaroo we don't want him to swallow anything sylvie explained </s>
<s> he's not hungry </s>
<s> but we want to see him </s>
<s> so will you please certainly the gardener promptly replied </s>
<s> always please </s>
<s> never displeases nobody </s>
<s> there you are and he flung the door open and let us out upon the dusty high road </s>
<s> we soon found our way to the bush which had so mysteriously sunk into the ground and here sylvie drew the magic locket from its hiding place turned it over with thoughtful air and at last appealed to bruno in rather helpless way </s>
<s> what was it we had to do with it bruno </s>
<s> it's all gone out of my head kiss it was bruno's invariable recipe in cases of doubt and difficulty </s>
<s> sylvie kissed it but no result followed </s>
<s> rub it the wrong way was bruno's next suggestion </s>
<s> which is the wrong way sylvie most reasonably enquired </s>
<s> the obvious plan was to try both ways </s>
<s> rubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever </s>
<s> from right to left oh stop sylvie bruno cried in sudden alarm </s>
<s> whatever is going to happen for number of trees on the neighbouring hillside were moving slowly upwards in solemn procession while mild little brook that had been rippling at our feet moment before began to swell and foam and hiss and bubble in truly alarming fashion </s>
<s> rub it some other way cried bruno </s>
<s> try up and down </s>

<s> is it possible my lady replied </s>

<s> and my precious child too </s>

<s> kindly attend to that little matter professor as soon as you have corrected the feverishness </s>
<s> and by the way professor the professor left his distinguished pupil standing at the door and meekly returned there is rumour afloat that the people wish to elect an in point of fact an you understand that mean an not another professor the poor old man exclaimed in horror </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> certainly not the vice warden eagerly explained </s>
<s> merely an emperor you understand an emperor cried the astonished professor holding his head between his hands as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock </s>
<s> what will the warden why the warden will most likely be the new emperor my lady explained </s>
<s> where could we find better </s>
<s> unless perhaps she glanced at her husband </s>
<s> where indeed the professor fervently responded quite failing to take the hint </s>
<s> the vice warden resumed the thread of his discourse </s>
<s> the reason mentioned it professor was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at the election </s>
<s> you see it would make the thing respectable no suspicion of anything underhand fear ca'n your excellency the old man faltered </s>
<s> what will the warden true true the vice warden interrupted </s>

<s> well well </s>

<s> the other professor </s>
<s> we were looking for you cried sylvie in tone of great relief </s>
<s> we do want you so much you ca'n think what is it dear children the professor asked beaming on them with very different look from what uggug ever got from him </s>
<s> we want you to speak to the gardener for us sylvie said as she and bruno took the old man's hands and led him into the hall </s>
<s> he's ever so unkind bruno mournfully added </s>
<s> they's all unkind to us now that father's gone </s>
<s> the lion were much nicer but you must explain to me please the professor said with an anxious look which is the lion and which is the gardener </s>
<s> it's most important not to get two such animals confused together </s>
<s> and one's very liable to do it in their case both having mouths you know doos oo always confuses two animals together bruno asked </s>
<s> pretty often i'm afraid the professor candidly confessed </s>
<s> now for instance there's the rabbit hutch and the hall clock the professor pointed them out </s>
<s> one gets little confused with them both having doors you know </s>
<s> now only yesterday would you believe it put some lettuces into the clock and tried to wind up the rabbit did the rabbit go after oo wounded it up said bruno </s>
<s> the professor clasped his hands on the top of his head and groaned </s>
<s> go </s>
<s> should think it did go </s>
<s> why it's gone </s>
<s> and where ever it's gone to that's what ca'n find out </s>
<s> i've done my best i've read all the article rabbit in the great dictionary come in only the tailor sir with your little bill said meek voice outside the door </s>
<s> ah well can soon settle his business the professor said to the children if you'll just wait minute </s>
<s> how much is it this year my man the tailor had come in while he was speaking </s>
<s> well it's been doubling so many years you see the tailor replied little gruffly and think i'd like the money now </s>
<s> it's two thousand pound it is oh that's nothing the professor carelessly remarked feeling in his pocket as if he always carried at least that amount about with him </s>
<s> but wouldn't you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand </s>
<s> just think how rich you'd be </s>
<s> why you might be king if you liked don't know as i'd care about being king the man said thoughtfully </s>
<s> but it dew sound powerful sight money </s>
<s> well think i'll wait of course you will said the professor </s>
<s> there's good sense in you see </s>
<s> good day to you my man will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor </s>
<s> never my child the professor replied emphatically </s>
<s> he'll go on doubling it till he dies </s>
<s> you see it's always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money </s>
<s> and now what would you like to do my little friends </s>
<s> shall take you to see the other professor </s>
<s> this would be an excellent opportunity for visit he said to himself glancing at his watch he generally takes short rest of fourteen minutes and half about this time bruno hastily went round to sylvie who was standing at the other side of the professor and put his hand into hers </s>
<s> thinks we'd like to go he said doubtfully only please let's go all together </s>
<s> it's best to be on the safe side oo know why you talk as if you were sylvie exclaimed the professor </s>
<s> know did bruno replied very humbly </s>
<s> quite forgotted wasn't sylvie </s>
<s> only fought he might be rarver fierce the professor laughed jolly laugh </s>
<s> oh he's quite tame he said </s>
<s> he never bites </s>
<s> he's only little little dreamy you know he took hold of bruno's other hand and led the children down long passage had never noticed before not that there was anything remarkable in that was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that mysterious palace and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones again </s>
<s> near the end of the passage the professor stopped </s>
<s> this is his room he said pointing to the solid wall </s>
<s> we ca'n get in through there bruno exclaimed </s>
<s> sylvie said nothing till she had carefully examined whether the wall opened anywhere </s>
<s> then she laughed merrily </s>
<s> you're playing us trick you dear old thing she said </s>
<s> there's no door here there isn't any door to the room said the professor </s>
<s> we shall have to climb in at the window so we went into the garden and soon found the window of the other professor's room </s>
<s> it was ground floor window and stood invitingly open the professor first lifted the two children in and then he and climbed in after them </s>
<s> image the other professor the other professor was seated at table with large book open before him on which his forehead was resting he had clasped his arms round the book and was snoring heavily </s>
<s> he usually reads like that the professor remarked when the book's very interesting and then sometimes it's very difficult to get him to attend this seemed to be one of the difficult times the professor lifted him up once or twice and shook him violently but he always returned to his book the moment he was let go of and showed by his heavy breathing that the book was as interesting as ever </s>
<s> how dreamy he is the professor exclaimed </s>
<s> he must have got to very interesting part of the book and he rained quite shower of thumps on the other professor's back shouting hoy </s>
<s> hoy all the time </s>
<s> isn't it wonderful that he should be so dreamy he said to bruno </s>
<s> if he's always as sleepy as that bruno remarked course he's dreamy but what are we to do said the professor </s>
<s> you see he's quite wrapped up in the book suppose oo shuts the book bruno suggested </s>
<s> that's it cried the delighted professor </s>
<s> of course that'll do it and he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the other professor's nose between the leaves and gave it severe pinch </s>
<s> the other professor instantly rose to his feet and carried the book away to the end of the room where he put it back in its place in the book case </s>
<s> i've been reading for eighteen hours and three quarters he said and now shall rest for fourteen minutes and half </s>
<s> is the lecture all ready very nearly the professor humbly replied </s>
<s> shall ask you to give me hint or two there will be few little difficulties and banquet think you said oh yes </s>
<s> the banquet comes first of course </s>
<s> people never enjoy abstract science you know when they're ravenous with hunger </s>
<s> and then there's the fancy dress ball </s>
<s> oh there'll be lots of entertainment where will the ball come in said the other professor </s>
<s> think it had better come at the beginning of the banquet it brings people together so nicely you know yes that's the right order </s>
<s> first the meeting then the eating then the treating for i'm sure any lecture you give us will be treat said the other professor who had been standing with his back to us all this time occupying himself in taking the books out one by one and turning them upside down </s>
<s> an easel with black board on it stood near him and every time that he turned book upside down he made mark on the board with piece of chalk </s>
<s> and as to the pig tale which you have so kindly promised to give us the professor went on thoughtfully rubbing his chin </s>
<s> think that had better come at the end of the banquet then people can listen to it quietly shall sing it the other professor asked with smile of delight </s>
<s> if you can the professor replied cautiously </s>
<s> let me try said the other professor seating himself at the pianoforte </s>
<s> for the sake of argument let us assume that it begins on flat and he struck the note in question </s>
<s> la la la </s>
<s> think that's within an octave of it he struck the note again and appealed to bruno who was standing at his side </s>
<s> did sing it like that my child no oo didn't bruno replied with great decision </s>
<s> it were more like duck single notes are apt to have that effect the other professor said with sigh </s>
<s> let me try whole verse </s>
<s> there was pig that sat alone beside ruined pump </s>
<s> by day and night he made his moan it would have stirred heart of stone to see him wring his hoofs and groan because he could not jump </s>
<s> would you call that tune professor he asked when he had finished </s>
<s> the professor considered little </s>
<s> well he said at last some of the notes are the same as others and some are different but should hardly call it tune let me try it bit by myself said the other professor </s>
<s> and he began touching the notes here and there and humming to himself like an angry bluebottle </s>
<s> how do you like his singing the professor asked the children in low voice </s>
<s> it isn't very beautiful sylvie said hesitatingly </s>
<s> it's very extremely ugly bruno said without any hesitation at all </s>
<s> all extremes are bad the professor said very gravely </s>
<s> for instance sobriety is very good thing when practised in moderation but even sobriety when carried to an extreme has its disadvantages what are its disadvantages was the question that rose in my mind and as usual bruno asked it for me </s>
<s> what are its lizard bandages well this is one of them said the professor </s>
<s> when man's tipsy that's one extreme you know he sees one thing as two </s>
<s> but when he's extremely sober that's the other extreme he sees two things as one </s>
<s> it's equally inconvenient whichever happens </s>
<s> what does illconvenient mean bruno whispered to sylvie </s>
<s> the difference between convenient and inconvenient is best explained by an example said the other professor who had overheard the question </s>
<s> if you'll just think over any poem that contains the two words such as the professor put his hands over his ears with look of dismay </s>
<s> if you once let him begin poem he said to sylvie he'll never leave off again </s>
<s> he never does did he ever begin poem and not leave off again sylvie enquired </s>
<s> three times said the professor </s>
<s> bruno raised himself on tiptoe till his lips were on level with sylvie's ear </s>
<s> what became of them three poems he whispered </s>
<s> is he saying them all now hush said sylvie </s>
<s> the other professor is speaking i'll say it very quick murmured the other professor with downcast eyes and melancholy voice which contrasted oddly with his face as he had forgotten to leave off smiling </s>
<s> at least it wasn't exactly smile as sylvie said afterwards it looked as if his mouth was made that shape go on then said the professor </s>
<s> what must be must be remember that sylvie whispered to bruno it's very good rule for whenever you hurt yourself and it's very good rule for whenever make noise said the saucy little fellow </s>
<s> so you remember it too miss whatever do you mean said sylvie trying to frown thing she never managed particularly well </s>
<s> oftens and oftens said bruno haven't oo told me there mustn't be so much noise bruno when i've tolded oo there must why there isn't no rules at all about there mustn't </s>
<s> but oo never believes me as if any one could believe you you wicked wicked boy said sylvie </s>
<s> the words were severe enough but am of opinion that when you are really anxious to impress criminal with sense of his guilt you ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his cheek since kiss at the end of it however accidental weakens the effect terribly </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> peter and paul </s>
<s> as was saying the other professor resumed if you'll just think over any poem that contains the words such as peter is poor said noble paul and have always been his friend and though my means to give are small at least can afford to lend </s>
<s> how few in this cold age of greed do good except on selfish grounds </s>
<s> but can feel for peter's need and will lend him fifty pounds how great was peter's joy to find his friend in such genial vein </s>

<s> on may the fourth it must be paid well well said peter with sigh </s>
<s> hand me the cash and will go </s>
<s> i'll form joint stock company and turn an honest pound or so i'm grieved said paul to seem unkind the money shalt of course be lent but for week or two find it will not be convenient so week by week poor peter came and turned in heaviness away for still the answer was the same cannot manage it to day and now the april showers were dry the five short weeks were nearly spent yet still he got the old reply it is not quite convenient the fourth arrived and punctual paul came with his legal friend at noon </s>
<s> thought it best said he to call one cannot settle things too soon poor peter shuddered in despair his flowing locks he wildly tore and very soon his yellow hair was lying all about the floor </s>
<s> the legal friend was standing by with sudden pity half unmanned the tear drop trembled in his eye the signed agreement in his hand but when at length the legal soul resumed its customary force the law he said we ca'n control pay or the law must take its course said paul how bitterly rue that fatal morning when called </s>

<s> yet why so strict </s>
<s> is this to act friendly part </s>
<s> however legal it may be to pay what never has been lent this style of business seems to me extremely inconvenient </s>
<s> no nobleness of soul have like some that in this age are found paul blushed in sheer humility and cast his eyes upon the ground this debt will simply swallow all and make my life life of woe nay nay nay peter answered paul </s>
<s> you must not rail on fortune so </s>
<s> you have enough to eat and drink you are respected in the world and at the barber's as think you often get your whiskers curled </s>
<s> though nobleness you ca'n attain to any very great extent the path of honesty is plain however inconvenient tis true said peter i'm alive keep my station in the world once in the week just contrive to get my whiskers oiled and curled </s>
<s> but my assets are very low my little income's overspent to trench on capital you know is always inconvenient but pay your debts cried honest paul </s>
<s> my gentle peter pay your debts </s>
<s> what matter if it swallows all that you describe as your assets </s>
<s> already you're an hour behind yet generosity is best </s>
<s> it pinches me but never mind </s>
<s> will not charge you interest how good </s>
<s> how great poor peter cried </s>
<s> yet must sell my sunday wig the scarf pin that has been my pride my grand piano and my pig full soon his property took wings and daily as each treasure went he sighed to find the state of things grow less and less convenient </s>

<s> yours is an enviable lot </s>

<s> you little guessed how deep it drained my slender store but there's heart within this breast and will lend you fifty more not so was peter's mild reply his cheeks all wet with grateful tears no man recalls so well as your services in bygone years and this new offer admit is very very kindly meant still to avail myself of it would not be quite convenient you'll see in moment what the difference is between convenient and inconvenient you quite understand it now don't you he added looking kindly at bruno who was sitting at sylvie's side on the floor </s>
<s> yes said bruno very quietly </s>
<s> such short speech was very unusual for him but just then he seemed fancied little exhausted </s>
<s> in fact he climbed up into sylvie's lap as he spoke and rested his head against her shoulder </s>
<s> what many verses it was he whispered </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> musical gardener </s>
<s> the other professor regarded him with some anxiety </s>
<s> the smaller animal ought to go to bed at once he said with an air of authority </s>
<s> why at once said the professor </s>
<s> because he can't go at twice said the other professor </s>
<s> the professor gently clapped his hands </s>
<s> isn't he wonderful he said to sylvie </s>
<s> nobody else could have thought of the reason so quick </s>
<s> why of course he ca'n go at twice </s>
<s> it would hurt him to be divided this remark woke up bruno suddenly and completely </s>
<s> don't want to be divided he said decisively </s>
<s> it does very well on diagram said the other professor </s>
<s> could show it you in minute only the chalk's little blunt take care sylvie anxiously exclaimed as he began rather clumsily to point it </s>
<s> you'll cut your finger off if you hold the knife so if oo cuts it off will oo give it to me please </s>
<s> bruno thoughtfully added </s>
<s> it's like this said the other professor hastily drawing long line upon the black board and marking the letters at the two ends and in the middle let me explain it to you </s>
<s> if ab were to be divided into two parts at it would be drownded bruno pronounced confidently </s>
<s> the other professor gasped </s>
<s> what would be drownded why the bumble bee of course said bruno </s>
<s> and the two bits would sink down in the sea here the professor interfered as the other professor was evidently too much puzzled to go on with his diagram </s>
<s> when said it would hurt him was merely referring to the action of the nerves the other professor brightened up in moment </s>
<s> the action of the nerves he began eagerly is curiously slow in some people </s>
<s> had friend once that if you burnt him with red hot poker it would take years and years before he felt it and if you only pinched him queried sylvie </s>
<s> then it would take ever so much longer of course </s>
<s> in fact doubt if the man himself would ever feel it at all </s>
<s> his grandchildren might wouldn't like to be the grandchild of pinched grandfather would you mister sir bruno whispered </s>
<s> it might come just when you wanted to be happy that would be awkward admitted taking it quite as matter of course that he had so suddenly caught sight of me </s>
<s> but don't you always want to be happy bruno not always bruno said thoughtfully </s>
<s> sometimes when i's too happy wants to be little miserable </s>
<s> then just tell sylvie about it oo know and sylvie sets me some lessons </s>
<s> then it's all right i'm sorry you don't like lessons said </s>
<s> you should copy sylvie </s>
<s> she's always as busy as the day is long well so am said bruno </s>
<s> no no sylvie corrected him </s>
<s> you're as busy as the day is short well what's the difference bruno asked </s>
<s> mister sir isn't the day as short as it's long </s>
<s> mean isn't it the same length never having considered the question in this light suggested that they had better ask the professor and they ran off in moment to appeal to their old friend </s>
<s> the professor left off polishing his spectacles to consider </s>
<s> my dears he said after minute the day is the same length as anything that is the same length as it and he resumed his never ending task of polishing </s>
<s> the children returned slowly and thoughtfully to report his answer </s>
<s> isn't he wise sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper </s>
<s> if was as wise as that should have head ache all day long </s>
<s> know should you appear to be talking to somebody that isn't here the professor said turning round to the children </s>
<s> who is it bruno looked puzzled </s>
<s> never talks to nobody when he isn't here he replied </s>
<s> it isn't good manners </s>
<s> oo should always wait till he comes before oo talks to him the professor looked anxiously in my direction and seemed to look through and through me without seeing me </s>
<s> then who are you talking to he said </s>
<s> there isn't anybody here you know except the other professor and he isn't here he added wildly turning round and round like teetotum </s>
<s> children </s>
<s> help to look for him </s>
<s> quick </s>
<s> he's got lost again the children were on their feet in moment </s>
<s> where shall we look said sylvie </s>
<s> anywhere shouted the excited professor </s>
<s> only be quick about it and he began trotting round and round the room lifting up the chairs and shaking them </s>
<s> bruno took very small book out of the bookcase opened it and shook it in imitation of the professor </s>
<s> he isn't here he said </s>
<s> he ca'n be there bruno sylvie said indignantly </s>
<s> course he ca'n said bruno </s>
<s> should have shooked him out if he'd been in there has he ever been lost before sylvie enquired turning up corner of the hearth rug and peeping under it </s>
<s> once before said the professor he once lost himself in wood and couldn't he find his self again said bruno </s>
<s> why didn't he shout </s>
<s> he'd be sure to hear his self cause he couldn't be far off oo know lets try shouting said the professor </s>
<s> what shall we shout said sylvie </s>
<s> on second thoughts don't shout the professor replied </s>
<s> the vice warden might hear you </s>
<s> he's getting awfully strict this reminded the poor children of all the troubles about which they had come to their old friend </s>
<s> bruno sat down on the floor and began crying </s>
<s> he is so cruel he sobbed </s>
<s> and he lets uggug take away all my toys </s>
<s> and such horrid meals what did you have for dinner to day said the professor </s>
<s> little piece of dead crow was bruno's mournful reply </s>
<s> he means rook pie sylvie explained </s>
<s> it were dead crow bruno persisted </s>
<s> and there were apple pudding and uggug ate it all and got nuffin but crust </s>
<s> and asked for orange and didn't get it and the poor little fellow buried his face in sylvie's lap who kept gently stroking his hair as she went on </s>
<s> it's all true professor dear </s>
<s> they do treat my darling bruno very badly </s>
<s> and they're not kind to me either she added in lower tone as if that were thing of much less importance </s>
<s> the professor got out large red silk handkerchief and wiped his eyes </s>
<s> wish could help you dear children he said </s>
<s> but what can do we know the way to fairyland where father's gone quite well said sylvie if only the gardener would let us out won't he open the door for you said the professor </s>
<s> not for us said sylvie but i'm sure he would for you </s>
<s> do come and ask him professor dear i'll come this minute said the professor </s>
<s> bruno sat up and dried his eyes </s>
<s> isn't he kind mister sir he is indeed said </s>
<s> but the professor took no notice of my remark </s>
<s> he had put on beautiful cap with long tassel and was selecting one of the other professor's walking sticks from stand in the corner of the room </s>
<s> thick stick in one's hand makes people respectful he was saying to himself </s>
<s> come along dear children and we all went out into the garden together </s>
<s> shall address him first of all the professor explained as we went along with few playful remarks on the weather </s>
<s> shall then question him about the other professor </s>
<s> this will have double advantage </s>
<s> first it will open the conversation you can't even drink bottle of wine without opening it first and secondly if he's seen the other professor we shall find him that way and if he hasn't we sha'n on our way we passed the target at which uggug had been made to shoot during the ambassador's visit </s>
<s> see said the professor pointing out hole in the middle of the bull's eye </s>
<s> his imperial fatness had only one shot at it and he went in just here </s>
<s> bruno carefully examined the hole </s>
<s> couldn't go in there he whispered to me </s>
<s> he are too fat we had no sort of difficulty in finding the gardener </s>
<s> though he was hidden from us by some trees that harsh voice of his served to direct us and as we drew nearer the words of his song became more and more plainly audible he thought he saw an albatross that fluttered round the lamp he looked again and found it was penny postage stamp </s>
<s> you'd best be getting home he said the nights are very damp image he thought he saw an albatross would it be afraid of catching cold said bruno </s>
<s> if it got very damp sylvie suggested it might stick to something you know and that somefin would have to go by the post what ever it was bruno eagerly exclaimed </s>
<s> suppose it was cow </s>
<s> wouldn't it be dreadful for the other things and all these things happened to him said the professor </s>
<s> that's what makes the song so interesting he must have had very curious life said sylvie </s>
<s> you may say that the professor heartily rejoined </s>
<s> of course she may cried bruno </s>
<s> by this time we had come up to the gardener who was standing on one leg as usual and busily employed in watering bed of flowers with an empty watering can </s>
<s> it hasn't got no water in it bruno explained to him pulling his sleeve to attract his attention </s>
<s> it's lighter to hold said the gardener </s>
<s> lot of water in it makes one's arms ache and he went on with his work singing softly to himself the nights are very damp in digging things out of the ground which you probably do now and then the professor began in loud voice in making things into heaps which no doubt you often do and in kicking things about with one heel which you seem never to leave off doing have you ever happened to notice another professor something like me but different never shouted the gardener so loudly and violently that we all drew back in alarm </s>
<s> there ain't such thing we will try less exciting topic the professor mildly remarked to the children </s>
<s> you were asking we asked him to let us through the garden door said sylvie but he wouldn't but perhaps he would for you the professor put the request very humbly and courteously </s>
<s> wouldn't mind letting you out said the gardener </s>
<s> but mustn't open the door for children </s>
<s> d'you think i'd disobey the rules </s>
<s> not for one and sixpence the professor cautiously produced couple of shillings </s>
<s> that'll do it the gardener shouted as he hurled the watering can across the flower bed and produced handful of keys one large one and number of small ones </s>
<s> but look here professor dear whispered sylvie </s>
<s> he needn't open the door for us at all </s>
<s> we can go out with you true dear child the professor thankfully replied as he replaced the coins in his pocket </s>
<s> that saves two shillings and he took the children's hands that they might all go out together when the door was opened </s>
<s> this however did not seem very likely event though the gardener patiently tried all the small keys over and over again </s>
<s> at last the professor ventured on gentle suggestion </s>
<s> why not try the large one </s>
<s> have often observed that door unlocks much more nicely with its own key the very first trial of the large key proved success the gardener opened the door and held out his hand for the money </s>
<s> the professor shook his head </s>
<s> you are acting by rule he explained in opening the door for me </s>
<s> and now it's open we are going out by rule the rule of three the gardener looked puzzled and let us go out but as he locked the door behind us we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself he thought he saw garden door that opened with key he looked again and found it was double rule of three and all its mystery he said is clear as day to me shall now return said the professor when we had walked few yards you see it's impossible to read here for all my books are in the house but the children still kept fast hold of his hands </s>
<s> do come with us sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes </s>
<s> well well said the good natured old man </s>
<s> perhaps i'll come after you some day soon </s>
<s> but must go back now </s>
<s> you see left off at comma and it's so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes </s>
<s> besides you've got to go through dogland first and i'm always little nervous about dogs </s>
<s> but it'll be quite easy to come as soon as i've completed my new invention for carrying one's self you know </s>
<s> it wants just little more working out won't that be very tiring to carry yourself sylvie enquired </s>
<s> well no my child </s>
<s> you see whatever fatigue one incurs by carrying one saves by being carried </s>
<s> good bye dears </s>
<s> good bye sir he added to my intense surprise giving my hand an affectionate squeeze </s>
<s> good bye professor replied but my voice sounded strange and far away and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell </s>
<s> evidently they neither saw me nor heard me as with their arms lovingly twined round each other they marched boldly on </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> visit to dogland </s>
<s> there's house away there to the left said sylvie after we had walked what seemed to me about fifty miles </s>
<s> let's go and ask for night's lodging it looks very comfable house bruno said as we turned into the road leading up to it </s>
<s> doos hope the dogs will be kind to us is so tired and hungry mastiff dressed in scarlet collar and carrying musket was pacing up and down like sentinel in front of the entrance </s>
<s> he started on catching sight of the children and came forwards to meet them keeping his musket pointed straight at bruno who stood quite still though he turned pale and kept tight hold of sylvie's hand while the sentinel walked solemnly round and round them and looked at them from all points of view </s>
<s> image the mastiff sentinel oobooh hooh boohooyah he growled at last </s>
<s> woobah yahwah oobooh </s>
<s> bow wahbah woobooyah </s>
<s> bow wow he asked bruno severely </s>
<s> of course bruno understood all this easily enough </s>
<s> all fairies understand doggee that is dog language </s>
<s> but as you may find it little difficult just at first had better put it into english for you </s>
<s> humans verily believe </s>
<s> couple of stray humans </s>
<s> what dog do you belong to </s>
<s> what do you want we don't belong to dog bruno began in doggee </s>
<s> peoples never belongs to dogs he whispered to sylvie but sylvie hastily checked him for fear of hurting the mastiff's feelings </s>
<s> please we want little food and night's lodging if there's room in the house she added timidly </s>
<s> sylvie spoke doggee very prettily but think it's almost better for you to give the conversation in english </s>
<s> the house indeed growled the sentinel </s>
<s> have you never seen palace in your life </s>
<s> come along with me </s>
<s> his majesty must settle what's to be done with you they followed him through the entrance hall down long passage and into magnificent saloon around which were grouped dogs of all sorts and sizes </s>
<s> two splendid blood hounds were solemnly sitting up one on each side of the crown bearer </s>
<s> two or three bull dogs whom guessed to be the body guard of the king were waiting in grim silence in fact the only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs who had mounted settee and were holding lively discussion that looked very like quarrel </s>
<s> lords and ladies in waiting and various court officials our guide gruffly remarked as he led us in </s>
<s> of me the courtiers took no notice whatever but sylvie and bruno were the subject of many inquisitive looks and many whispered remarks of which only distinctly caught one made by sly looking dachshund to his friend bah wooh wahyah hoobah oobooh hah bah she's not such bad looking human is she leaving the new arrivals in the centre of the saloon the sentinel advanced to door at the further end of it which bore an inscription painted on it in doggee royal kennel scratch and yell before doing this the sentinel turned to the children and said give me your names we'd rather not bruno exclaimed pulling sylvie away from the door </s>
<s> we want them ourselves </s>
<s> come back sylvie </s>
<s> come quick nonsense said sylvie very decidedly and gave their names in doggee </s>
<s> then the sentinel scratched violently at the door and gave yell that made bruno shiver from head to foot </s>
<s> hooyah wah said deep voice inside </s>
<s> that's doggee for come in it's the king himself the mastiff whispered in an awestruck tone </s>
<s> take off your wigs and lay them humbly at his paws what we should call at his feet sylvie was just going to explain very politely that really they couldn't perform that ceremony because their wigs wouldn't come off when the door of the royal kennel opened and an enormous newfoundland dog put his head out </s>
<s> bow wow was his first question </s>
<s> when his majesty speaks to you the sentinel hastily whispered to bruno you should prick up your ears bruno looked doubtfully at sylvie </s>
<s> i'd rather not please he said </s>
<s> it would hurt image the dog king it doesn't hurt bit the sentinel said with some indignation </s>
<s> look </s>
<s> it's like this and he pricked up his ears like two railway signals </s>
<s> sylvie gently explained matters </s>
<s> i'm afraid we ca'n manage it she said in low voice </s>
<s> i'm very sorry but our ears haven't got the right she wanted to say machinery in doggee but she had forgotten the word and could only think of steam engine the sentinel repeated sylvie's explanation to the king </s>
<s> can't prick up their ears without steam engine his majesty exclaimed </s>
<s> they must be curious creatures </s>
<s> must have look at them and he came out of his kennel and walked solemnly up to the children </s>
<s> what was the amazement nor to say the horror of the whole assembly when sylvie actually patted his majesty on the head while bruno seized his long ears and pretended to tie them together under his chin </s>
<s> the sentinel groaned aloud beautiful greyhound who appeared to be one of the ladies in waiting fainted away and all the other courtiers hastily drew back and left plenty of room for the huge newfoundland to spring upon the audacious strangers and tear them limb from limb </s>
<s> only he didn't </s>
<s> on the contrary his majesty actually smiled so far as dog can smile and the other dogs couldn't believe their eyes but it was true all the same his majesty wagged his tail </s>
<s> yah </s>
<s> hooh hahwooh that is well </s>
<s> never was the universal cry </s>
<s> his majesty looked round him severely and gave slight growl which produced instant silence </s>
<s> conduct my friends to the banqueting hall he said laying such an emphasis on my friends that several of the dogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick bruno's feet </s>
<s> procession was formed but only ventured to follow as far as the door of the banqueting hall so furious was the uproar of barking dogs within </s>
<s> so sat down by the king who seemed to have gone to sleep and waited till the children returned to say good night when his majesty got up and shook himself </s>
<s> time for bed he said with sleepy yawn </s>
<s> the attendants will show you your room he added aside to sylvie and bruno </s>
<s> bring lights and with dignified air he held out his paw for them to kiss </s>
<s> but the children were evidently not well practised in court manners </s>
<s> sylvie simply stroked the great paw bruno hugged it the master of the ceremonies looked shocked </s>
<s> all this time dog waiters in splendid livery were running up with lighted candles but as fast as they put them upon the table other waiters ran away with them so that there never seemed to be one for me though the master kept nudging me with his elbow and repeating ca'n let you sleep here </s>
<s> you're not in bed you know made great effort and just succeeded in getting out the words know i'm not </s>
<s> i'm in an arm chair well forty winks will do you no harm the master said and left me </s>
<s> could scarcely hear his words and no wonder he was leaning over the side of ship that was miles away from the pier on which stood </s>
<s> the ship passed over the horizon and sank back into the arm chair </s>
<s> the next thing remember is that it was morning breakfast was just over sylvie was lifting bruno down from high chair and saying to spaniel who was regarding them with most benevolent smile yes thank you we've had very nice breakfast </s>
<s> haven't we bruno there was too many bones in the bruno began but sylvie frowned at him and laid her finger on her lips for at this moment the travelers were waited on by very dignified officer the head growler whose duty it was first to conduct them to the king to bid him farewell and then to escort them to the boundary of dogland </s>
<s> the great newfoundland received them most affably but instead of saying good bye he startled the head growler into giving three savage growls by announcing that he would escort them himself </s>
<s> it is most unusual proceeding your majesty </s>
<s> the head growler exclaimed almost choking with vexation at being set aside for he had put on his best court suit made entirely of cat skins for the occasion </s>
<s> shall escort them myself his majesty repeated gently but firmly laying aside the royal robes and changing his crown for small coronet and you may stay at home are glad bruno whispered to sylvie when they had got well out of hearing </s>
<s> he were so welly cross and he not only patted their royal escort but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his delight </s>
<s> his majesty calmly wagged the royal tail </s>
<s> it's quite relief he said getting away from that palace now and then </s>
<s> royal dogs have dull life of it can tell you </s>
<s> would you mind this to sylvie in low voice and looking little shy and embarrassed would you mind the trouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch sylvie was too much astonished to do anything for moment it sounded such monstrous impossibility that king should wish to run after stick </s>
<s> but bruno was equal to the occasion and with glad shout of hi then </s>
<s> fetch it good doggie he hurled it over clump of bushes </s>
<s> the next moment the monarch of dogland had bounded over the bushes and picked up the stick and came galloping back to the children with it in his mouth </s>
<s> bruno took it from him with great decision </s>
<s> beg for it he insisted and his majesty begged </s>
<s> paw commanded sylvie and his majesty gave his paw </s>
<s> in short the solemn ceremony of escorting the travelers to the boundaries of dogland became one long uproarious game of play </s>
<s> but business is business the dog king said at last </s>
<s> and must go back to mine </s>
<s> couldn't come any further he added consulting dog watch which hung on chain round his neck not even if there were cat insight they took an affectionate farewell of his majesty and trudged on </s>
<s> that were dear dog bruno exclaimed </s>
<s> has we to go far sylvie </s>
<s> i's tired not much further darling sylvie gently replied </s>
<s> do you see that shining just beyond those trees </s>
<s> i'm almost sure it's the gate of fairyland </s>
<s> know it's all golden father told me so and so bright so bright she went on dreamily </s>
<s> it dazzles said bruno shading his eyes with one little hand while the other clung tightly to sylvie's hand as if he were half alarmed at her strange manner </s>
<s> for the child moved on as if walking in her sleep her large eyes gazing into the far distance and her breath coming and going in quick pantings of eager delight </s>
<s> knew by some mysterious mental light that great change was taking place in my sweet little friend for such loved to think her and that she was passing from the condition of mere outland sprite into the true fairy nature </s>
<s> upon bruno the change came later but it was completed in both before they reached the golden gate through which knew it would be impossible for me to follow </s>
<s> could but stand outside and take last look at the two sweet children ere they disappeared within and the golden gate closed with bang </s>
<s> and with such bang </s>
<s> it never will shut like any other cupboard door arthur explained </s>
<s> there's something wrong with the hinge </s>
<s> however here's the cake and wine </s>
<s> and you've had your forty winks </s>
<s> so you really must get off to bed old man </s>
<s> you're fit for nothing else </s>
<s> witness my hand arthur forester by this time was wide awake again </s>
<s> not quite yet pleaded </s>
<s> really i'm not sleepy now </s>
<s> and it isn't midnight yet well did want to say another word to you arthur replied in relenting tone as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed </s>
<s> only thought you were too sleepy for it to night we took our midnight meal almost in silence for an unusual nervousness seemed to have seized on my old friend </s>
<s> what kind of night is it he asked rising and undrawing the window curtains apparently to change the subject for minute </s>
<s> followed him to the window and we stood together looking out in silence </s>
<s> when first spoke to you about arthur began after long and embarrassing silence that is when we first talked about her for think it was you that introduced the subject my own position in life forbade me to do more than worship her from distance and was turning over plans for leaving this place finally and settling somewhere out of all chance of meeting her again </s>
<s> that seemed to be my only chance of usefulness in life </s>
<s> would that have been wise said </s>
<s> to leave yourself no hope at all there was no hope to leave arthur firmly replied though his eyes glittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky from which one solitary star the glorious vega blazed out in fitful splendour through the driving clouds </s>
<s> she was like that star to me bright beautiful and pure but out of reach out of reach he drew the curtains again and we returned to our places by the fireside </s>
<s> what wanted to tell you was this he resumed </s>
<s> heard this evening from my solicitor </s>
<s> can't go into the details of the business but the upshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than thought and am or shall soon be in position to offer marriage without imprudence to any lady even if she brought nothing </s>
<s> doubt if there would be anything on her side the earl is poor believe </s>
<s> but should have enough for both even if health failed wish you all happiness in your married life cried </s>
<s> shall you speak to the earl to morrow not yet awhile said arthur </s>
<s> he is very friendly but dare not think he means more than that as yet </s>
<s> and as for as for lady muriel try as may cannot read her feelings towards me </s>
<s> if there is love she is hiding it </s>
<s> no must wait must wait did not like to press any further advice on my friend whose judgment felt was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own and we parted without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts nay his very life </s>
<s> the next morning letter from my solicitor arrived summoning me to town on important business </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> fairy sylvle </s>
<s> for full month the business for which had returned to london detained me there and even then it was only the urgent advice of my physician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit to elveston </s>
<s> arthur had written once or twice during the month but in none of his letters was there any mention of lady muriel </s>
<s> still did not augur ill from his silence to me it looked like the natural action of lover who even while his heart was singing she is mine would fear to paint his happiness in the cold phrases of written letter but would wait to tell it by word of mouth </s>
<s> yes thought am to hear his song of triumph from his own lips the night arrived we had much to say on other matters and tired with the journey went to bed early leaving the happy secret still untold </s>
<s> next day however as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon ventured to put the momentous question </s>
<s> well old friend you have told me nothing of lady muriel nor when the happy day is to be the happy day arthur said looking unexpectedly grave is yet in the dim future </s>
<s> we need to know or rather she needs to know me better </s>
<s> know her sweet nature thoroughly by this time </s>
<s> but dare not speak till am sure that my love is returned don't wait too long said gaily </s>
<s> faint heart never won fair lady it is faint heart perhaps </s>
<s> but really dare not speak just yet but meanwhile pleaded you are running risk that perhaps you have not thought of </s>
<s> some other man no said arthur firmly </s>
<s> she is heart whole am sure of that </s>
<s> yet if she loves another better than me so be it </s>
<s> will not spoil her happiness </s>
<s> the secret shall die with me </s>
<s> but she is my first and my only love that is all very beautiful sentiment said but it is not practical </s>
<s> it is not like you </s>
<s> he either fears his fate too much or his desert is small who dares not put it to the touch to win or lose it all dare not ask the question whether there is another he said passionately </s>
<s> it would break my heart to know it yet is it wise to leave it unasked </s>
<s> you must not waste your life upon an if tell you dare not may find it out for you asked with the freedom of an old friend </s>
<s> no no he replied with pained look </s>
<s> entreat you to say nothing </s>
<s> let it wait as you please said and judged it best to say no more just then </s>
<s> but this evening thought will call on the earl </s>
<s> may be able to see how the land lies without so much as saying word it was very hot afternoon too hot to go for walk or do anything or else it wouldn't have happened believe </s>
<s> in the first place want to know dear child who reads this why fairies should always be teaching us to do our duty and lecturing us when we go wrong and we should never teach them anything </s>
<s> you can't mean to say that fairies are never greedy or selfish or cross or deceitful because that would be nonsense you know </s>
<s> well then don't you think they might be all the better for little lecturing and punishing now and then </s>
<s> really don't see why it shouldn't be tried and i'm almost sure that if you could only catch fairy and put it in the corner and give it nothing but bread and water for day or two you'd find it quite an improved character it would take down its conceit little at all events </s>
<s> the next question is what is the best time for seeing fairies </s>
<s> believe can tell you all about that </s>
<s> the first rule is that it must be very hot day that we may consider as settled and you must be just little sleepy but not too sleepy to keep your eyes open mind </s>
<s> well and you ought to feel little what one may call fairyish the scotch call it eerie and perhaps that's prettier word if you don't know what it means i'm afraid can hardly explain it you must wait till you meet fairy and then you'll know </s>
<s> and the last rule is that the crickets should not be chirping </s>
<s> can't stop to explain that you must take it on trust for the present </s>
<s> so if all these things happen together you have good chance of seeing fairy or at least much better chance than if they didn't </s>
<s> the first thing noticed as went lazily along through an open place in the wood was large beetle lying struggling on its back and went down upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again </s>
<s> in some things you know you ca'n be quite sure what an insect would like for instance never could quite settle supposing were moth whether would rather be kept out of the candle or be allowed to fly straight in and get burnt or again supposing were spider i'm not sure if should be quite pleased to have my web torn down and the fly let loose but feel quite certain that if were beetle and had rolled over on my back should always be glad to be helped up again </s>
<s> so as was saying had gone down upon one knee and was just reaching out little stick to turn the beetle over when saw sight that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature way </s>
<s> not that she looked as if she would be easily frightened she seemed so good and gentle that i'm sure she would never expect that any one could wish to hurt her </s>
<s> she was only few inches high and was dressed in green so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long grass and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to belong to the place almost as if she were one of the flowers </s>
<s> may tell you besides that she had no wings don't believe in fairies with wings and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large earnest brown eyes and then shall have done all can to give you an idea of her </s>
<s> image fairy sylvie sylvie found out her name afterwards had knelt down just as was doing to help the beetle but it needed more than little stick for her to get it on its legs again it was as much as she could do with both arms to roll the heavy thing over and all the while she was talking to it half scolding and half comforting as nurse might do with child that had fallen down </s>
<s> there there </s>
<s> you needn't cry so much about it </s>
<s> you're not killed yet though if you were you couldn't cry you know and so it's general rule against crying my dear </s>
<s> and how did you come to tumble over </s>
<s> but can see well enough how it was needn't ask you that walking over sand pits with your chin in the air as usual </s>
<s> of course if you go among sand pits like that you must expect to tumble </s>
<s> you should look the beetle murmured something that sounded like did look and sylvie went on again </s>
<s> but know you didn't </s>
<s> you never do </s>
<s> you always walk with your chin up you're so dreadfully conceited </s>
<s> well let's see how many legs are broken this time </s>
<s> why none of them declare </s>
<s> and what's the good of having six legs my dear if you can only kick them all about in the air when you tumble </s>
<s> legs are meant to walk with you know </s>
<s> now don't begin putting out your wings yet i've more to say </s>
<s> go to the frog that lives behind that buttercup give him my compliments sylvie's compliments can you say compliments the beetle tried and suppose succeeded </s>
<s> yes that's right </s>
<s> and tell him he's to give you some of that salve left with him yesterday </s>
<s> and you'd better get him to rub it in for you </s>
<s> he's got rather cold hands but you mustn't mind that think the beetle must have shuddered at this idea for sylvie went on in graver tone </s>
<s> now you needn't pretend to be so particular as all that as if you were too grand to be rubbed by frog </s>
<s> the fact is you ought to be very much obliged to him </s>
<s> suppose you could get nobody but toad to do it how would you like that there was little pause and then sylvie added now you may go </s>
<s> be good beetle and don't keep your chin in the air and then began one of those performances of humming and whizzing and restless banging about such as beetle indulges in when it has decided on flying but hasn't quite made up its mind which way to go </s>
<s> at last in one of its awkward zigzags it managed to fly right into my face and by the time had recovered from the shock the little fairy was gone </s>
<s> looked about in all directions for the little creature but there was no trace of her and my eerie feeling was quite gone off and the crickets were chirping again merrily so knew she was really gone </s>
<s> and now i've got time to tell you the rule about the crickets </s>
<s> they always leave off chirping when fairy goes by because fairy's kind of queen over them suppose at all events it's much grander thing than cricket so whenever you're walking out and the crickets suddenly leave off chirping you may be sure that they see fairy </s>
<s> walked on sadly enough you may be sure </s>
<s> however comforted myself with thinking it's been very wonderful afternoon so far </s>
<s> i'll just go quietly on and look about me and shouldn't wonder if were to come across another fairy somewhere peering about in this way happened to notice plant with rounded leaves and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of them </s>
<s> ah the leafcutter bee carelessly remarked you know am very learned in natural history for instance can always tell kittens from chickens at one glance and was passing on when sudden thought made me stoop down and examine the leaves </s>
<s> then little thrill of delight ran through me for noticed that the holes were all arranged so as to form letters there were three leaves side by side with and marked on them and after some search found two more which contained an and an and then all in moment flash of inner light seemed to illumine part of my life that had all but faded into oblivion the strange visions had experienced during my journey to elveston and with thrill of delight thought those visions are destined to be linked with my waking life by this time the eerie feeling had come back again and suddenly observed that no crickets were chirping so felt quite sure that bruno was somewhere very near </s>
<s> and so indeed he was so near that had very nearly walked over him without seeing him which would have been dreadful always supposing that fairies can be walked over my own belief is that they are something of the nature of will the wisps and there's no walking over them </s>
<s> think of any pretty little boy you know with rosy cheeks large dark eyes and tangled brown hair and then fancy him made small enough to go comfortably into coffee cup and you'll have very fair idea of him </s>
<s> what's your name little one began in as soft voice as could manage </s>
<s> and by the way why is it we always begin by asking little children their names </s>
<s> is it because we fancy name will help to make them little bigger </s>
<s> you never thought of as king real large man his name now did you </s>
<s> but however that may be felt it quite necessary to know his name so as he didn't answer my question asked it again little louder </s>
<s> what's your name my little man what's oors he said without looking up </s>
<s> told him my name quite gently for he was much too small to be angry with </s>
<s> duke of anything he asked just looking at me for moment and then going on with his work </s>
<s> not duke at all said little ashamed of having to confess it </s>
<s> oo're big enough to be two dukes said the little creature </s>
<s> suppose oo're sir something then no said feeling more and more ashamed </s>
<s> haven't got any title the fairy seemed to think that in that case really wasn't worth the trouble of talking to for he quietly went on digging and tearing the flowers to pieces </s>
<s> after few minutes tried again </s>
<s> please tell me what your name is bruno the little fellow answered very readily </s>
<s> why didn't oo say please before that's something like what we used to be taught in the nursery thought to myself looking back through the long years about hundred of them since you ask the question to the time when was little child </s>
<s> and here an idea came into my head and asked him aren't you one of the fairies that teach children to be good well we have to do that sometimes said bruno and dreadful bother it is as he said this he savagely tore heartsease in two and trampled on the pieces </s>
<s> what are you doing there bruno said </s>
<s> spoiling sylvie's garden was all the answer bruno would give at first </s>
<s> but as he went on tearing up the flowers he muttered to himself the nasty cross thing wouldn't let me go and play this morning said must finish my lessons first lessons indeed </s>
<s> i'll vex her finely though oh bruno you shouldn't do that cried </s>
<s> don't you know that's revenge </s>
<s> and revenge is wicked cruel dangerous thing river edge said bruno </s>
<s> what funny word </s>
<s> suppose oo call it cruel and dangerous cause if oo wented too far and tumbleded in oo'd get drownded no not river edge explained revenge saying the word very slowly </s>
<s> but couldn't help thinking that bruno's explanation did very well for either word </s>
<s> oh said bruno opening his eyes very wide but without trying to repeat the word </s>
<s> come </s>
<s> try and pronounce it bruno said cheerfully </s>
<s> re venge re venge but bruno only tossed his little head and said he couldn't that his mouth wasn't the right shape for words of that kind </s>
<s> and the more laughed the more sulky the little fellow got about it </s>
<s> well never mind my little man said </s>
<s> shall help you with that job yes please bruno said quite pacified </s>
<s> only wiss could think of somefin to vex her more than this </s>
<s> oo don't know how hard it is to make her angry now listen to me bruno and i'll teach you quite splendid kind of revenge somefin that'll vex her finely he asked with gleaming eyes </s>
<s> something that will vex her finely </s>
<s> first we'll get up all the weeds in her garden </s>
<s> see there are good many at this end quite hiding the flowers but that won't vex her said bruno </s>
<s> after that said without noticing the remark we'll water this highest bed up here </s>
<s> you see it's getting quite dry and dusty bruno looked at me inquisitively but he said nothing this time </s>
<s> then after that went on the walks want sweeping bit and think you might cut down that tall nettle it's so close to the garden that it's quite in the way what is oo talking about bruno impatiently interrupted me </s>
<s> all that won't vex her bit won't it said innocently </s>
<s> then after that suppose we put in some of these coloured pebbles just to mark the divisions between the different kinds of flowers you know </s>
<s> that'll have very pretty effect bruno turned round and had another good stare at me </s>
<s> at last there came an odd little twinkle into his eyes and he said with quite new meaning in his voice that'll do nicely </s>
<s> let's put em in rows all the red together and all the blue together </s>
<s> that'll do capitally said and then what kind of flowers does sylvie like best bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider little before he could answer </s>
<s> violets he said at last </s>
<s> there's beautiful bed of violets down by the brook oh let's fetch em cried bruno giving little skip into the air </s>
<s> here </s>
<s> catch hold of my hand and i'll help oo along </s>
<s> the grass is rather thick down that way couldn't help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what big creature he was talking to </s>
<s> no not yet bruno said we must consider what's the right thing to do first </s>
<s> you see we've got quite business before us yes let's consider said bruno putting his thumb into his mouth again and sitting down upon dead mouse </s>
<s> what do you keep that mouse for said </s>
<s> you should either bury it or else throw it into the brook why it's to measure with cried bruno </s>
<s> how ever would oo do garden without one </s>
<s> we make each bed three mouses and half long and two mouses wide stopped him as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it was used for was half afraid the eerie feeling might go off before we had finished the garden and in that case should see no more of him or sylvie </s>
<s> think the best way will be for you to weed the beds while sort out these pebbles ready to mark the walks with that's it cried bruno </s>
<s> and i'll tell oo about the caterpillars while we work ah let's hear about the caterpillars said as drew the pebbles together into heap and began dividing them into colours </s>
<s> and bruno went on in low rapid tone more as if he were talking to himself </s>
<s> yesterday saw two little caterpillars when was sitting by the brook just where oo go into the wood </s>
<s> they were quite green and they had yellow eyes and they didn't see me </s>
<s> and one of them had got moth's wing to carry great brown moth's wing oo know all dry with feathers </s>
<s> so he couldn't want it to eat should think perhaps he meant to make cloak for the winter perhaps said for bruno had twisted up the last word into sort of question and was looking at me for an answer </s>
<s> one word was quite enough for the little fellow and he went on merrily </s>
<s> well and so he didn't want the other caterpillar to see the moth's wing oo know so what must he do but try to carry it with all his left legs and he tried to walk on the other set </s>
<s> of course he toppled over after that after what said catching at the last word for to tell the truth hadn't been attending much </s>
<s> he toppled over bruno repeated very gravely and if oo ever saw caterpillar topple over oo'd know it's welly serious thing and not sit grinning like that and sha'n tell oo no more indeed and indeed bruno didn't mean to grin </s>
<s> see i'm quite grave again now but bruno only folded his arms and said don't tell me </s>
<s> see little twinkle in one of oor eyes just like the moon why do you think i'm like the moon bruno asked </s>
<s> oor face is large and round like the moon bruno answered looking at me thoughtfully </s>
<s> it doosn't shine quite so bright but it's more cleaner couldn't help smiling at this </s>
<s> you know sometimes wash my face bruno </s>
<s> the moon never does that oh doosn't she though cried bruno and he leant forwards and added in solemn whisper the moon's face gets dirtier and dirtier every night till it's black all across </s>
<s> and then when it's dirty all over so he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke then she washes it then it's all clean again isn't it not all in moment said bruno </s>
<s> what deal of teaching oo wants </s>
<s> she washes it little by little only she begins at the other edge oo know by this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms folded and the weeding wasn't getting on bit so had to say work first pleasure afterwards no more talking till that bed's finished chapter </s>
<s> bruno's revenge </s>
<s> after that we had few minutes of silence while sorted out the pebbles and amused myself with watching bruno's plan of gardening </s>
<s> it was quite new plan to me he always measured each bed before he weeded it as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink and once when it came out longer than he wished he set to work to thump the mouse with his little fist crying out there now </s>
<s> it's all gone wrong again </s>
<s> why don't oo keep oor tail straight when tell oo i'll tell you what i'll do bruno said in half whisper as we worked </s>
<s> oo like fairies don't oo yes said of course do or shouldn't have come here </s>
<s> should have gone to some place where there are no fairies bruno laughed contemptuously </s>
<s> why oo might as well say oo'd go to some place where there wasn't any air supposing oo didn't like air this was rather difficult idea to grasp </s>
<s> tried change of subject </s>
<s> you're nearly the first fairy ever saw </s>
<s> have you ever seen any people besides me plenty said bruno </s>
<s> we see'em when we walk in the road but they ca'n see you </s>
<s> how is it they never tread on you ca'n tread on us said bruno looking amused at my ignorance </s>
<s> why suppose oo're walking here so making little marks on the ground and suppose there's fairy that's me walking here </s>
<s> very well then oo put one foot here and one foot here so oo doosn't tread on the fairy this was all very well as an explanation but it didn't convince me </s>
<s> why shouldn't put one foot on the fairy asked </s>
<s> don't know why the little fellow said in thoughtful tone </s>
<s> but know oo wouldn't </s>
<s> nobody never walked on the top of fairy </s>
<s> now i'll tell oo what i'll do as oo're so fond of fairies </s>
<s> i'll get oo an invitation to the fairy king's dinner party </s>
<s> know one of the head waiters couldn't help laughing at this idea </s>
<s> do the waiters invite the guests asked </s>
<s> oh not to sit down bruno said </s>
<s> but to wait at table </s>
<s> oo'd like that wouldn't oo </s>
<s> to hand about plates and so on well but that's not so nice as sitting at the table is it of course it isn't bruno said in tone as if he rather pitied my ignorance but if oo're not even sir anything oo ca'n expect to be allowed to sit at the table oo know said as meekly as could that didn't expect it but it was the only way of going to dinner party that really enjoyed </s>
<s> and bruno tossed his head and said in rather offended tone that might do as pleased there were many he knew that would give their ears to go </s>
<s> have you ever been yourself bruno they invited me once last week bruno said very gravely </s>
<s> it was to wash up the soup plates no the cheese plates mean that was grand enough </s>
<s> and waited at table </s>
<s> and didn't hardly make only one mistake what was it said </s>
<s> you needn't mind telling me only bringing scissors to cut the beef with bruno said carelessly </s>
<s> but the grandest thing of all was fetched the king glass of cider that was grand said biting my lip to keep myself from laughing </s>
<s> wasn't it said bruno very earnestly </s>
<s> oo know it isn't every one that's had such an honour as that this set me thinking of the various queer things we call an honour in this world but which after all haven't bit more honour in them than what bruno enjoyed when he took the king glass of cider </s>
<s> don't know how long might not have dreamed on in this way if bruno hadn't suddenly roused me </s>
<s> oh come here quick he cried in state of the wildest excitement </s>
<s> catch hold of his other horn </s>
<s> ca'n hold him more than minute he was struggling desperately with great snail clinging to one of its horns and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag it over blade of grass </s>
<s> saw we should have no more gardening if let this sort of thing go on so quietly took the snail away and put it on bank where he couldn't reach it </s>
<s> we'll hunt it afterwards bruno said if you really want to catch it </s>
<s> but what's the use of it when you've got it what's the use of fox when oo've got it said bruno </s>
<s> know oo big things hunt foxes tried to think of some good reason why big things should hunt foxes and he should not hunt snails but none came into my head so said at last well suppose one's as good as the other </s>
<s> i'll go snail hunting myself some day should think oo wouldn't be so silly said bruno as to go snail hunting by oor self </s>
<s> why oo'd never get the snail along if oo hadn't somebody to hold on to his other horn of course sha'n go alone said quite gravely </s>
<s> by the way is that the best kind to hunt or do you recommend the ones without shells oh no we never hunt the ones without shells bruno said with little shudder at the thought of it </s>
<s> they're always so cross about it and then if oo tumbles over them they're ever so sticky by this time we had nearly finished the garden </s>
<s> had fetched some violets and bruno was just helping me to put in the last when he suddenly stopped and said i'm tired rest then said can go on without you quite well bruno needed no second invitation he at once began arranging the dead mouse as kind of sofa </s>
<s> and i'll sing oo little song he said as he rolled it about </s>
<s> do said like songs very much which song will oo choose bruno said as he dragged the mouse into place where he could get good view of me </s>
<s> ting ting ting is the nicest there was no resisting such strong hint as this however pretended to think about it for moment and then said well like ting ting ting best of all image bruno's revenge that shows oo're good judge of music bruno said with pleased look </s>
<s> how many hare bells would oo like and he put his thumb into his mouth to help me to consider </s>
<s> as there was only one cluster of hare bells within easy reach said very gravely that thought one would do this time and picked it and gave it to him </s>
<s> bruno ran his hand once or twice up and down the flowers like musician trying an instrument producing most delicious delicate tinkling as he did so </s>
<s> had never heard flower music before don't think one can unless one's in the eerie state and don't know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like except by saying that it sounded like peal of bells thousand miles off </s>
<s> when he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune he seated himself on the dead mouse he never seemed really comfortable anywhere else and looking up at me with merry twinkle in his eyes he began </s>
<s> by the way the tune was rather curious one and you might like to try it for yourself so here are the notes </s>
<s> image music for hare bells rise oh rise </s>
<s> the daylight dies the owls are hooting ting ting ting </s>
<s> wake oh wake </s>
<s> beside the lake the elves are fluting ting ting ting </s>
<s> welcoming our fairy king we sing sing sing he sang the first four lines briskly and merrily making the hare bells chime in time with the music but the last two he sang quite slowly and gently and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards </s>
<s> then he left off to explain </s>
<s> the fairy king is oberon and he lives across the lake and sometimes he comes in little boat and we go and meet him and then we sing this song you know and then you go and dine with him said mischievously </s>
<s> oo shouldn't talk bruno hastily said it interrupts the song so said wouldn't do it again </s>
<s> never talk myself when i'm singing he went on very gravely so oo shouldn't either then he tuned the hare bells once more and sang hear oh hear </s>
<s> from far and near the music stealing ting ting ting </s>
<s> fairy belts adown the dells are merrily pealing ting ting ting </s>
<s> welcoming our fairy king we ring ring ring </s>
<s> see oh see </s>
<s> on every tree what lamps are shining ting ting ting </s>
<s> they are eyes of fiery flies to light our dining ting ting ting </s>
<s> welcoming our fairy king they swing swing swing </s>
<s> haste oh haste to take and taste the dainties waiting ting ting ting </s>
<s> honey dew is stored hush bruno interrupted in warning whisper </s>
<s> she's coming bruno checked his song and as she slowly made her way through the long grass he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like little bull shouting look the other way </s>
<s> look the other way which way sylvie asked in rather frightened tone as she looked round in all directions to see where the danger could be </s>
<s> that way said bruno carefully turning her round with her face to the wood </s>
<s> now walk backwards walk gently don't be frightened oo sha'n trip but sylvie did trip notwithstanding in fact he led her in his hurry across so many little sticks and stones that it was really wonder the poor child could keep on her feet at all </s>
<s> but he was far too much excited to think of what he was doing </s>
<s> silently pointed out to bruno the best place to lead her to so as to get view of the whole garden at once it was little rising ground about the height of potato and when they had mounted it drew back into the shade that sylvie mightn't see me </s>
<s> heard bruno cry out triumphantly now oo may look and then followed clapping of hands but it was all done by bruno himself </s>
<s> sylvie was silent she only stood and gazed with her hands clasped together and was half afraid she didn't like it after all </s>
<s> bruno too was watching her anxiously and when she jumped down off the mound and began wandering up and down the little walks he cautiously followed her about evidently anxious that she should form her own opinion of it all without any hint from him </s>
<s> and when at last she drew long breath and gave her verdict in hurried whisper and without the slightest regard to grammar it's the loveliest thing as never saw in all my life before the little fellow looked as well pleased as if it had been given by all the judges and juries in england put together </s>
<s> and did you really do it all by yourself bruno said sylvie </s>
<s> and all for me was helped bit bruno began with merry little laugh at her surprise </s>
<s> we've been at it all the afternoon thought oo'd like and here the poor little fellow's lip began to quiver and all in moment he burst out crying and running up to sylvie he flung his arms passionately round her neck and hid his face on her shoulder </s>
<s> there was little quiver in sylvie's voice too as she whispered why what's the matter darling and tried to lift up his head and kiss him </s>
<s> but bruno only clung to her sobbing and wouldn't be comforted till he had confessed </s>
<s> tried to spoil oor garden first but i'll never never and then came another burst of tears which drowned the rest of the sentence </s>
<s> at last he got out the words liked putting in the flowers for oo sylvie and never was so happy before and the rosy little face came up at last to be kissed all wet with tears as it was </s>
<s> sylvie was crying too by this time and she said nothing but bruno dear and never was so happy before though why these two children who had never been so happy before should both be crying was mystery to me </s>
<s> felt very happy too but of course didn't cry big things never do you know we leave all that to the fairies </s>
<s> only think it must have been raining little just then for found drop or two on my cheeks </s>
<s> after that they went through the whole garden again flower by flower as if it were long sentence they were spelling out with kisses for commas and great hug by way of full stop when they got to the end </s>
<s> doos oo know that was my river edge sylvie bruno solemnly began </s>
<s> sylvie laughed merrily </s>
<s> what do you mean she said </s>
<s> and she pushed back her heavy brown hair with both hands and looked at him with dancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering </s>
<s> bruno drew in long breath and made up his mouth for great effort </s>
<s> mean revenge he said now oo under'tand and he looked so happy and proud at having said the word right at last that quite envied him </s>
<s> rather think sylvie didn't under'tand at all but she gave him little kiss on each cheek which seemed to do just as well </s>
<s> so they wandered off lovingly together in among the buttercups each with an arm twined round the other whispering and laughing as they went and never so much as once looked back at poor me </s>
<s> yes once just before quite lost sight of them bruno half turned his head and nodded me saucy little good bye over one shoulder </s>
<s> and that was all the thanks got for my trouble </s>
<s> the very last thing saw of them was this sylvie was stooping down with her arms round bruno's neck and saying coaxingly in his ear do you know bruno i've quite forgotten that hard word </s>
<s> do say it once more </s>
<s> come </s>
<s> only this once dear but bruno wouldn't try it again </s>

<s> lady muriel and her father gave me delightfully warm welcome </s>
<s> they were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing rooms who conceal all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable mask of conventional placidity </s>
<s> the man with the iron mask was no doubt rarity and marvel in his own age in modern london no one would turn his head to give him second look </s>
<s> no these were real people </s>

<s> i'm sure day in the country would do him good </s>
<s> i'm afraid he studies too much it was on the tip of my tongue to quote the words his only books are woman's looks but checked myself just in time with something of the feeling of one who has crossed street and has been all but run over by passing hansom and think he has too lonely life she went on with gentle earnestness that left no room whatever to suspect double meaning </s>
<s> do get him to come </s>

<s> no he feared to wear out his welcome he said they had seen enough of him for one while and when at last the day for the expedition arrived he was so childishly nervous and uneasy that thought it best so to arrange our plans that we should go separately to the house my intention being to arrive some time after him so as to give him time to get over meeting </s>
<s> with this object purposely made considerable circuit on my way to the hall as we called the earl's house and if could only manage to lose my way bit thought to myself that would suit me capitally in this succeeded better and sooner than had ventured to hope for </s>

<s> but hope there are no snakes about mused aloud taking my seat on fallen tree </s>
<s> certainly do not like snakes and don't suppose bruno likes them either no he doesn't like them said demure little voice at my side </s>
<s> he's not afraid of them you know </s>
<s> but he doesn't like them </s>
<s> he says they're too waggly words fail me to describe the beauty of the little group couched on patch of moss on the trunk of the fallen tree that met my eager gaze sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss and her rosy cheek resting in the palm of her hand and bruno stretched at her feet with his head in her lap </s>
<s> image fairies resting too waggly was all could say in so sudden an emergency </s>
<s> i'm not praticular bruno said carelessly but do like straight animals best but you like dog when it wags its tail sylvie interrupted </s>
<s> you know you do bruno but there's more of dog isn't there mister sir bruno appealed to me </s>
<s> you wouldn't like to have dog if it hadn't got nuffin but head and tail admitted that dog of that kind would be uninteresting </s>
<s> there isn't such dog as that sylvie thoughtfully remarked </s>
<s> but there would be cried bruno if the professor shortened it up for us shortened it up said </s>
<s> that's something new </s>
<s> how does he do it he's got curious machine sylvie was beginning to explain </s>
<s> welly curious machine bruno broke in not at all willing to have the story thus taken out of his mouth and if oo puts in some finoruvver at one end oo know and he turns the handle and it comes out at the uvver end oh ever so short as short as short </s>
<s> sylvie echoed </s>
<s> and one day when we was in outland oo know before we came to fairyland me and sylvie took him big crocodile </s>
<s> and he shortened it up for us </s>
<s> and it did look so funny </s>
<s> and it kept looking round and saying wherever is the rest of me got to and then its eyes looked unhappy not both its eyes sylvie interrupted </s>
<s> course not said the little fellow </s>
<s> only the eye that couldn't see wherever the rest of it had got to </s>
<s> but the eye that could see wherever how short was the crocodile asked as the story was getting little complicated </s>
<s> half as short again as when we caught it so long said bruno spreading out his arms to their full stretch </s>
<s> tried to calculate what this would come to but it was too hard for me </s>
<s> please make it out for me dear child who reads this </s>
<s> but you didn't leave the poor thing so short as that did you well no </s>
<s> sylvie and me took it back again and we got it stretched to to how much was it sylvie two times and half and little bit more said sylvie </s>
<s> it wouldn't like that better than the other way i'm afraid oh but it did though bruno put in eagerly </s>
<s> it were proud of its new tail </s>
<s> oo never saw crocodile so proud </s>
<s> why it could go round and walk on the top of its tail and along its back all the way to its head image changed crocodile not quite all the way said sylvie </s>
<s> it couldn't you know ah but it did once bruno cried triumphantly </s>
<s> oo weren't looking but watched it </s>
<s> and it walked on tippiety toe so as it wouldn't wake itself cause it thought it were asleep </s>
<s> and it got both its paws on its tail </s>
<s> and it walked and it walked all the way along its back </s>
<s> and it walked and it walked on its forehead </s>
<s> and it walked tiny little way down its nose </s>
<s> there now this was good deal worse than the last puzzle </s>
<s> please dear child help again </s>
<s> don't believe no crocodile never walked along its own forehead sylvie cried too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of her negatives </s>
<s> oo don't know the reason why it did it bruno scornfully retorted </s>
<s> it had welly good reason </s>
<s> heerd it say why shouldn't walk on my own forehead so course it did oo know if that's good reason bruno said why shouldn't you get up that tree shall in minute said bruno soon as we've done talking </s>

<s> why shouldn't we desert the picnic and go in some other direction she suddenly suggested </s>

<s> the one thing he dreads next to not being noticed is to be proved fallible </s>

<s> here in the foreground few clear touches are not amiss but back ground without mist you know </s>

<s> yes we need indistinctness the orator looked so pointedly at me as he uttered these words that felt bound to reply by murmuring something to the effect that hardly felt the need myself and that enjoyed looking at thing better when could see it </s>

<s> what lovely old ruin it is cried young lady in spectacles the very embodiment of the march of mind looking at lady muriel as the proper recipient of all really original remarks </s>
<s> and don't you admire those autumn tints on the trees </s>
<s> do intensely lady muriel shot meaning glance at me but replied with admirable gravity </s>
<s> oh yes indeed indeed </s>
<s> so true and isn't strange said the young lady passing with startling suddenness from sentiment to science that the mere impact of certain coloured rays upon the retina should give us such exquisite pleasure you have studied physiology then certain young doctor courteously enquired </s>
<s> oh yes </s>

<s> it seems paradox does it not he went on that the image formed on the retina should be inverted it is puzzling she candidly admitted </s>
<s> why is it we do not see things upside down you have never heard the theory then that the brain also is inverted no indeed </s>
<s> what beautiful fact </s>
<s> but how is it proved thus replied arthur with all the gravity of ten professors rolled into one </s>
<s> what we call the vertex of the brain is really its base and what we call its base is really its vertex it is simply question of nomenclature this last polysyllable settled the matter </s>
<s> how truly delightful the fair scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm </s>
<s> shall ask our physiological lecturer why he never gave us that exquisite theory i'd give something to be present when the question is asked arthur whispered to me as at signal from lady muriel we moved on to where the hampers had been collected and devoted ourselves to the more substantial business of the day </s>

<s> then supplied myself with plate of something solid and glass of something fluid and found place next to lady muriel </s>
<s> it had been left vacant apparently for arthur as distinguished stranger but he had turned shy and had placed himself next to the young lady in spectacles whose high rasping voice had already cast loose upon society such ominous phrases as man is bundle of qualities the objective is only attainable through the subjective </s>
<s> arthur was bearing it bravely but several faces wore look of alarm and thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic </s>
<s> in my nursery days began when the weather didn't suit for an out of doors picnic we were allowed to have peculiar kind that we enjoyed hugely </s>
<s> the table cloth was laid under the table instead of upon it we sat round it on the floor and believe we really enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the orthodox arrangement i've no doubt of it lady muriel replied </s>
<s> there's nothing well regulated child hates so much as regularity </s>
<s> believe really healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy greek grammar if only he might stand on his head to learn it </s>
<s> and your carpet dinner certainly spared you one feature of picnic which is to me its chief drawback the chance of shower suggested </s>
<s> no the chance or rather the certainty of live things occurring in combination with one's food </s>
<s> spiders are my bugbear </s>
<s> now my father has no sympathy with that sentiment have you dear for the earl had caught the word and turned to listen </s>
<s> to each his sufferings all are men he replied in the sweet sad tones that seemed natural to him each has his pet aversion but you'll never guess his lady muriel said with that delicate silvery laugh that was music to my ears </s>
<s> declined to attempt the impossible </s>
<s> he doesn't like snakes she said in stage whisper </s>
<s> now isn't that an unreasonable aversion </s>
<s> fancy not liking such dear coaxingly clingingly affectionate creature as snake not like snakes exclaimed </s>

<s> there was something so uncanny in this echo of the very words had so lately heard from that little forest sprite that it was only by great effort succeeded in saying carelessly let us banish so unpleasant topic </s>
<s> won't you sing us something lady muriel </s>

<s> and ca'n sing it not wizout oo plays it for me image three badgers writhing in cave instantly sylvie seated herself upon tiny mushroom that happened to grow in front of daisy as if it were the most ordinary musical instrument in the world and played on the petals as if they were the notes of an organ </s>
<s> and such delicious tiny music it was </s>
<s> such teeny tiny music </s>
<s> bruno held his head on one side and listened very gravely for few moments until he had caught the melody </s>

<s> sat up rubbed my eves and began to accumulate facts </s>
<s> smooth grassy slope bounded at the upper end by venerable ruins half buried in ivy at the lower by stream seen through arching trees dozen gaily dressed people seated in little groups here and there some open hampers the debris of picnic such were the facts accumulated by the scientific researcher </s>

<s> the researcher found himself at fault </s>
<s> yet stay </s>
<s> one fact had escaped his notice </s>
<s> while all the rest were grouped in twos and in threes arthur was alone while all tongues were talking his was silent while all faces were gay his was gloomy and despondent </s>
<s> here was fact indeed </s>
<s> the researcher felt that theory must be constructed without delay </s>
<s> lady muriel had just risen and left the party </s>
<s> could that be the cause of his despondency </s>
<s> the theory hardly rose to the dignity of working hypothesis </s>
<s> clearly more facts were needed </s>
<s> the researcher looked round him once more and now the facts accumulated in such bewildering profusion that the theory was lost among them </s>

<s> verily the theory looked gloomy for arthur </s>
<s> his eye caught mine and he crossed to me </s>
<s> he is very handsome said </s>
<s> abominably handsome muttered arthur then smiled at his own bitter words </s>
<s> lucky no one heard me but you doctor forester said lady muriel who had just joined us let me introduce to you my cousin eric lindon captain lindon should say arthur shook off his ill temper instantly and completely as he rose and gave the young soldier his hand </s>

<s> but it's something to begin with you must come to my father eric said lady muriel </s>
<s> think he's wandering among the ruins and the pair moved on </s>
<s> the gloomy look returned to arthur's face and could see it was only to distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the metaphysical young lady and resumed their interrupted discussion </s>
<s> talking of herbert spencer he began do you really find no logical difficulty in regarding nature as process of involution passing from definite coherent homogeneity to indefinite incoherent heterogeneity amused as was at the ingenious jumble he had made of spencer's words kept as grave face as could </s>
<s> no physical difficulty she confidently replied but haven't studied logic much </s>
<s> would you state the difficulty well said arthur do you accept it as self evident </s>
<s> is it as obvious for instance as that things that are greater than the same are greater than one another to my mind she modestly replied it seems quite as obvious </s>
<s> grasp both truths by intuition </s>
<s> but other minds may need some logical forget the technical terms for complete logical argument arthur began with admirable solemnity we need two prim misses of course she interrupted </s>
<s> remember that word now </s>
<s> and they produce delusion said arthur </s>
<s> ye es she said dubiously </s>
<s> don't seem to remember that so well </s>
<s> but what is the whole argument called sillygism </s>
<s> ah yes </s>
<s> remember now </s>
<s> but don't need sillygism you know to prove that mathematical axiom you mentioned nor to prove that all angles are equal suppose why of course not </s>
<s> one takes such simple truth as that for granted here ventured to interpose and to offer her plate of strawberries and cream </s>
<s> felt really uneasy at the thought that she might detect the trick and contrived unperceived by her to shake my head reprovingly at the pseudo philosopher </s>
<s> equally unperceived by her arthur slightly raised his shoulders and spread his hands abroad as who should say what else can say to her and moved away leaving her to discuss her strawberries by involution or any other way she preferred </s>
<s> by this time the carriages that were to convey the revelers to their respective homes had begun to assemble outside the castle grounds and it became evident now that lady muriel's cousin had joined our party that the problem how to convey five people to elveston with carriage that would only hold four must somehow be solved </s>
<s> the honorable eric lindon who was at this moment walking up and down with lady muriel might have solved it at once no doubt by announcing his intention of returning on foot </s>
<s> of this solution there did not seem to be the very smallest probability </s>
<s> the next best solution it seemed to me was that should walk home and this at once proposed </s>
<s> you're sure you don't mind said the earl </s>
<s> i'm afraid the carriage wont take us all and don't like to suggest to eric to desert his cousin so soon so far from minding it said should prefer it </s>
<s> it will give me time to sketch this beautiful old ruin i'll keep you company arthur suddenly said </s>

<s> shall be quite de trop in the carriage think i'll walk too said the earl </s>
<s> you'll have to be content with eric as your escort he added to lady muriel who had joined us while he was speaking </s>
<s> you must be as entertaining as cerberus three gentlemen rolled into one lady muriel said to her companion </s>
<s> it will be grand military exploit sort of forlorn hope the captain modestly suggested </s>
<s> you do pay pretty compliments laughed his fair cousin </s>
<s> good day to you gentlemen three or rather deserters three and the two young folk entered the carriage and were driven away </s>
<s> how long will your sketch take said arthur </s>
<s> well said should like an hour for it </s>
<s> don't you think you had better go without me </s>
<s> i'll return by train </s>
<s> know there's one in about an hour's time perhaps that would be best said the earl </s>
<s> the station is quite close so was left to my own devices and soon found comfortable seat at the foot of tree from which had good view of the ruins </s>
<s> it is very drowsy day said to myself idly turning over the leaves of the sketch book to find blank page </s>
<s> why thought you were mile off by this time for to my surprise the two walkers were back again </s>
<s> came back to remind you arthur said that the trains go every ten minutes nonsense said </s>
<s> it isn't the metropolitan railway it is the metropolitan railway the earl insisted </s>
<s> this is part of kensington why do you talk with your eyes shut said arthur </s>
<s> wake up think it's the heat makes me so drowsy said hoping but not feeling quite sure that was talking sense </s>
<s> am awake now think not the earl judicially pronounced </s>
<s> what do you think doctor </s>
<s> he's only got one eye open and he's snoring like anything cried bruno </s>
<s> do wake up you dear old thing and he and sylvie set to work rolling the heavy head from side to side as if its connection with the shoulders was matter of no sort of importance </s>
<s> and at last the professor opened his eyes and sat up blinking at us with eyes of utter bewilderment </s>
<s> would you have the kindness to mention he said addressing me with his usual old fashioned courtesy whereabouts we are just now and who we are beginning with me thought it best to begin with the children </s>
<s> this is sylvie </s>
<s> sir and this is bruno ah yes </s>
<s> know them well enough the old man murmured </s>
<s> its myself i'm most anxious about </s>
<s> and perhaps you'll be good enough to mention at the same time how got here harder problem occurs to me ventured to say and that is how you're to get back again true true the professor replied </s>
<s> that's the problem no doubt </s>
<s> viewed as problem outside of oneself it is most interesting one </s>
<s> viewed as portion of one's own biography it is must admit very distressing he groaned but instantly added with chuckle as to myself think you mentioned that am oo're the professor bruno shouted in his ear </s>
<s> didn't oo know that </s>
<s> oo've come from outland </s>
<s> and it's ever so far away from here the professor leapt to his feet with the agility of boy </s>
<s> then there's no time to lose he exclaimed anxiously </s>
<s> i'll just ask this guileless peasant with his brace of buckets that contain apparently water if he'll be so kind as to direct us </s>
<s> guileless peasant he proceeded in louder voice </s>
<s> would you tell us the way to outland the guileless peasant turned with sheepish grin </s>
<s> hey was all he said </s>
<s> the way to outland the professor repeated </s>
<s> the guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered </s>
<s> ah dunnot ought to mention the professor hastily put in that whatever you say will be used in evidence against you the guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets </s>
<s> then ah says nowt he answered briskly and walked away at great pace </s>
<s> the children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure </s>
<s> he goes very quick the professor said with sigh </s>
<s> but know that was the right thing to say </s>
<s> i've studied your english laws </s>
<s> however let's ask this next man that's coming </s>
<s> he is not guileless and he is not peasant but don't know that either point is of vital importance it was in fact the honourable eric lindon who had apparently fulfilled his task of escorting lady muriel home and was now strolling leisurely up and down the road outside the house enjoying solitary cigar </s>
<s> might trouble you sir to tell us the nearest way to outland oddity as he was in outward appearance the professor was in that essential nature which no outward disguise could conceal thorough gentleman </s>
<s> and as such eric lindon accepted him instantly </s>
<s> he took the cigar from his mouth and delicately shook off the ash while he considered </s>
<s> the name sounds strange to me he said </s>
<s> doubt if can help you it is not very far from fairyland the professor suggested </s>
<s> eric lindon's eye brows were slightly raised at these words and an amused smile which he courteously tried to repress flitted across his handsome face trifle cracked he muttered to himself </s>
<s> but what jolly old patriarch it is then he turned to the children </s>
<s> and ca'n you help him little folk he said with gentleness of tone that seemed to win their hearts at once </s>
<s> surely you know all about it </s>
<s> how many miles to babylon </s>
<s> three score miles and ten </s>
<s> can get there by candlelight </s>
<s> yes and back again to my surprise bruno ran forwards to him as if he were some old friend of theirs seized the disengaged hand and hung on to it with both of his own and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the road gravely swinging little boy to and fro while sylvie stood ready to push him exactly as if real swing had suddenly been provided for their pastime </s>
<s> we don't want to get to babylon oo know bruno explained as he swung </s>
<s> and it isn't candlelight it's daylight sylvie added giving the swing push of extra vigour which nearly took the whole machine off its balance </s>
<s> by this time it was clear to me that eric lindon was quite unconscious of my presence </s>
<s> even the professor and the children seemed to have lost sight of me and stood in the midst of the group as unconcernedly as ghost seeing but unseen </s>
<s> how perfectly isochronous the professor exclaimed with enthusiasm </s>
<s> he had his watch in his hand and was carefully counting bruno's oscillations </s>
<s> he measures time quite as accurately as pendulum image how perfectly isochronous yet even pendulums the good natured young soldier observed as he carefully released his hand from bruno's grasp are not joy for ever </s>
<s> come that's enough for one bout little man next time we meet you shall have another </s>
<s> meanwhile you'd better take this old gentleman to queer street number we'll find it cried bruno eagerly as they dragged the professor away </s>
<s> we are much indebted to you the professor said looking over his shoulder </s>
<s> don't mention it replied the officer raising his hat as parting salute </s>
<s> what number did you say the professor called from the distance </s>
<s> the officer made trumpet of his two hands </s>
<s> forty he shouted in stentorian tones </s>
<s> and not piano by any means he added to himself </s>
<s> it's mad world my masters mad world he lit another cigar and strolled on towards his hotel </s>
<s> what lovely evening said joining him as he passed me </s>
<s> lovely indeed he said </s>
<s> where did you come from </s>
<s> dropped from the clouds i'm strolling your way said and no further explanation seemed necessary </s>
<s> have cigar thanks i'm not smoker is there lunatic asylum near here not that know of thought there might be </s>
<s> met lunatic just now </s>
<s> queer old fish as ever saw and so in friendly chat we took our homeward ways and wished each other good night at the door of his hotel </s>
<s> left to myself felt the eerie feeling rush over me again and saw standing at the door of number forty the three figures knew so well </s>
<s> then it's the wrong house bruno was saying </s>
<s> no no </s>
<s> it's the right house the professor cheerfully replied but it's the wrong street </s>

<s> then he said to himself almost inaudibly where two or three are gathered together in my name there am in the midst of them yes assented no doubt that is the principle on which church going rests and when he does go he continued our thoughts ran so much together that our conversation was often slightly elliptical suppose he repeats the words believe in the communion of saints but by this time we had reached the little church into which goodly stream of worshipers consisting mainly of fishermen and their families was flowing </s>
<s> the service would have been pronounced by any modern aesthetic religionist or religious aesthete which is it to be crude and cold to me coming fresh from the ever advancing developments of london church under soi disant catholic rector it was unspeakably refreshing </s>
<s> there was no theatrical procession of demure little choristers trying their best not to simper under the admiring gaze of the congregation the people's share in the service was taken by the people themselves unaided except that few good voices judiciously posted here and there among them kept the singing from going too far astray </s>
<s> there was no murdering of the noble music contained in the bible and the liturgy by its recital in dead monotone with no more expression than mechanical talking doll </s>
<s> no the prayers were prayed the lessons were read and best of all the sermon was talked and found myself repeating as we left the church the words of jacob when he awaked out of his sleep surely the lord is in this place </s>
<s> this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven yes said arthur apparently in answer to my thoughts those high services are fast becoming pure formalism </s>
<s> more and more the people are beginning to regard them as performances in which they only assist in the french sense </s>
<s> and it is specially bad for the little boys </s>
<s> they'd be much less self conscious as pantomime fairies </s>
<s> with all that dressing up and stagy entrances and exits and being always en evidence no wonder if they're eaten up with vanity the blatant little coxcombs when we passed the hall on our return we found the earl and lady muriel sitting out in the garden </s>
<s> eric had gone for stroll </s>
<s> we joined them and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had just heard the subject of which was selfishness what change has come over our pulpits arthur remarked since the time when paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue the doing good to mankind in obedience to the will of god and for the sake of everlasting happiness lady muriel looked at him enquiringly but she seemed to have learned by intuition what years of experience had taught me that the way to elicit arthur's deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent but simply to listen </s>
<s> at that time he went on great tidal wave of selfishness was sweeping over human thought </s>
<s> right and wrong had somehow been transformed into gain and loss and religion had become sort of commercial transaction </s>
<s> we may be thankful that our preachers are beginning to take nobler view of life but is it not taught again and again in the bible ventured to ask </s>
<s> not in the bible as whole said arthur </s>
<s> in the old testament no doubt rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for action </s>
<s> that teaching is best for children and the israelites seem to have been mentally utter children </s>
<s> we guide our children thus at first but we appeal as soon as possible to their innate sense of right and wrong and when that stage is safely past we appeal to the highest motive of all the desire for likeness to and union with the supreme good </s>
<s> think you will find that to be the teaching of the bible as whole beginning with that thy days may be long in the land and ending with be ye perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect we were silent for awhile and then arthur went off on another tack </s>
<s> look at the literature of hymns now </s>
<s> how cankered it is through and through with selfishness </s>
<s> there are few human compositions more utterly degraded than some modern hymns quoted the stanza whatever lord we tend to thee repaid thousandfold shall be then gladly will we give to thee giver of all yes he said grimly that is the typical stanza </s>
<s> and the very last charity sermon heard was infected with it </s>
<s> after giving many good reasons for charity the preacher wound up with and for all you give you will be repaid thousandfold oh the utter meanness of such motive to be put before men who do know what self sacrifice is who can appreciate generosity and heroism </s>
<s> talk of original sin he went on with increasing bitterness </s>
<s> can you have stronger proof of the original goodness there must be in this nation than the fact that religion has been preached to us as commercial speculation for century and that we still believe in god it couldn't have gone on so long lady muriel musingly remarked if the opposition hadn't been practically silenced put under what the french call la cloture </s>
<s> surely in any lecture hall or in private society such teaching would soon have been hooted down trust so said arthur and though don't want to see brawling in church legalised must say that our preachers enjoy an enormous privilege which they ill deserve and which they misuse terribly </s>
<s> we put our man into pulpit and we virtually tell him now you may stand there and talk to us for half an hour </s>
<s> we won't interrupt you by so much as word </s>
<s> you shall have it all your own way and what does he give us in return </s>
<s> shallow twaddle that if it were addressed to you over dinner table you would think does the man take me for fool the return of eric from his walk checked the tide of arthur's eloquence and after few minutes talk on more conventional topics we took our leave </s>
<s> lady muriel walked with us to the gate </s>
<s> you have given me much to think about she said earnestly as she gave arthur her hand </s>
<s> i'm so glad you came in and her words brought real glow of pleasure into that pale worn face of his </s>
<s> on the tuesday as arthur did not seem equal to more walking took long stroll by myself having stipulated that he was not to give the whole day to his books but was to meet me at the hall at about tea time </s>
<s> on my way back passed the station just as the afternoon train came in sight and sauntered down the stairs to see it come in </s>
<s> but there was little to gratify my idle curiosity and when the train was empty and the platform clear found it was about time to be moving on if meant to reach the hall by five </s>
<s> as approached the end of the platform from which steep irregular wooden staircase conducted to the upper world noticed two passengers who had evidently arrived by the train but who oddly enough had entirely escaped my notice though the arrivals had been so few </s>
<s> they were young woman and little girl the former so far as one could judge by appearances was nursemaid or possibly nursery governess in attendance on the child whose refined face even more than her dress distinguished her as of higher class than her companion </s>
<s> the child's face was refined but it was also worn and sad one and told tale or so seemed to read it of much illness and suffering sweetly and patiently borne </s>
<s> she had little crutch to help herself along with and she was now standing looking wistfully up the long staircase and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin the toilsome ascent </s>
<s> there are some things one says in life as well as things one does which come automatically by reflex action as the physiologists say meaning no doubt action without reflection just as lucus is said to be derived non lucendo </s>
<s> closing one's eyelids when something seems to be flying into the eye is one of those actions and saying may carry the little girl up the stairs was another </s>
<s> it wasn't that any thought of offering help occurred to me and that then spoke the first intimation had of being likely to make that offer was the sound of my own voice and the discovery that the offer had been made </s>
<s> the servant paused doubtfully glancing from her charge to me and then back again to the child </s>
<s> would you like it dear she asked her </s>
<s> but no such doubt appeared to cross the child's mind she lifted her arms eagerly to be taken up </s>
<s> please was all she said while faint smile flickered on the weary little face </s>
<s> took her up with scrupulous care and her little arm was at once clasped trustfully round my neck </s>
<s> image the lame child she was very light weight so light in fact that the ridiculous idea crossed my mind that it was rather easier going up with her in my arms than it would have been without her and when we reached the road above with its cart ruts and loose stones all formidable obstacles for lame child found that had said i'd better carry her over this rough place before had formed any mental connection between its roughness and my gentle little burden </s>
<s> indeed it's troubling you too much sir the maid exclaimed </s>
<s> she can walk very well on the flat but the arm that was twined about my neck clung just an atom more closely at the suggestion and decided me to say she's no weight really </s>
<s> i'll carry her little further </s>
<s> i'm going your way the nurse raised no further objection and the next speaker was ragged little boy with bare feet and broom over his shoulder who ran across the road and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front of us </s>
<s> give us ap'ny the little urchin pleaded with broad grin on his dirty face </s>
<s> don't give him ap'ny said the little lady in my arms </s>
<s> the words sounded harsh but the tone was gentleness itself </s>
<s> he's an idle little boy and she laughed laugh of such silvery sweetness as had never yet heard from any lips but sylvie's </s>
<s> to my astonishment the boy actually joined in the laugh as if there were some subtle sympathy between them as he ran away down the road and vanished through gap in the hedge </s>
<s> but he was back in few moments having discarded his broom and provided himself from some mysterious source with an exquisite bouquet of flowers </s>
<s> buy posy buy posy </s>
<s> only ap'ny he chanted with the melancholy drawl of professional beggar </s>
<s> don't buy it was her majesty's edict as she looked down with lofty scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest on the ragged creature at her feet </s>
<s> but this time turned rebel and ignored the royal commands </s>
<s> such lovely flowers and of forms so entirely new to me were not to be abandoned at the bidding of any little maid however imperious </s>
<s> bought the bouquet and the little boy after popping the halfpenny into his mouth turned head over heels as if to ascertain whether the human mouth is really adapted to serve as money box </s>
<s> with wonder that increased every moment turned over the flowers and examined them one by one there was not single one among them that could remember having ever seen before </s>
<s> at last turned to the nursemaid </s>
<s> do these flowers grow wild about here </s>
<s> never saw but the speech died away on my lips </s>
<s> the nursemaid had vanished </s>
<s> you can put me down now if you like sylvie quietly remarked </s>
<s> obeyed in silence and could only ask myself is this dream on finding sylvie and bruno walking one on either side of me and clinging to my hands with the ready confidence of childhood </s>
<s> you're larger than when saw you last began </s>
<s> really think we ought to be introduced again </s>
<s> there's so much of you that never met before you know very well sylvie merrily replied </s>
<s> this is bruno </s>
<s> it doesn't take long </s>
<s> he's only got one name there's another name to me bruno protested with reproachful look at the mistress of the ceremonies </s>
<s> and it's esquire oh of course </s>
<s> forgot said sylvie </s>
<s> bruno esquire and did you come here to meet me my children enquired </s>
<s> you know said we'd come on tuesday sylvie explained </s>
<s> are we the proper size for common children quite the right size for children replied adding mentally though not common children by any means but what became of the nursemaid it are gone bruno solemnly replied </s>
<s> then it wasn't solid like sylvie and you no </s>
<s> oo couldn't touch it oo know </s>
<s> if oo walked at it oo'd go right froo quite expected you'd find it out once said sylvie </s>
<s> bruno ran it against telegraph post by accident </s>
<s> and it went in two halves </s>
<s> but you were looking the other way felt that had indeed missed an opportunity to witness such an event as nursemaid going in two halves does not occur twice in life time </s>
<s> when did oo guess it were sylvie bruno enquired </s>
<s> image it went in two halves didn't guess it till it was sylvie said </s>
<s> but how did you manage the nursemaid </s>
<s> bruno managed it said sylvie </s>
<s> it's called phlizz and how do you make phlizz bruno the professor teached me how said bruno </s>
<s> first oo takes lot of air oh bruno sylvie interposed </s>
<s> the professor said you weren't to tell but who did her voice asked </s>
<s> indeed it's troubling you too much sir </s>
<s> she can walk very well on the flat bruno laughed merrily as turned hastily from side to side looking in all directions for the speaker </s>
<s> that were me he gleefully proclaimed in his own voice </s>
<s> she can indeed walk very well on the flat said </s>
<s> and think was the flat by this time we were near the hall </s>
<s> this is where my friends live said </s>
<s> will you come in and have some tea with them bruno gave little jump of joy and sylvie said yes please </s>
<s> you'd like some tea bruno wouldn't you </s>
<s> he hasn't tasted tea she explained to me since we left outland and that weren't good tea said bruno </s>
<s> it were so welly weak chapter </s>
<s> light come light go </s>
<s> lady muriel's smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of surprise with which she regarded my new companions </s>
<s> presented them in due form </s>
<s> this is sylvie lady muriel </s>
<s> and this is bruno any surname she enquired her eyes twinkling with fun </s>
<s> no said gravely </s>
<s> no surname she laughed evidently thinking said it in fun and stooped to kiss the children salute to which bruno submitted with reluctance sylvie returned it with interest </s>
<s> while she and arthur who had arrived before me supplied the children with tea and cake tried to engage the earl in conversation but he was restless and distrait and we made little progress </s>
<s> at last by sudden question he betrayed the cause of his disquiet </s>
<s> would you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand willingly said handing him the bouquet </s>
<s> botany was knew favourite study of his and these flowers were to me so entirely new and mysterious that was really curious to see what botanist would say of them </s>
<s> they did not diminish his disquiet </s>
<s> on the contrary he became every moment more excited as he turned them over </s>
<s> these are all from central india he said laying aside part of the bouquet </s>
<s> they are rare even there and have never seen them in any other part of the world </s>
<s> these two are mexican this one he rose hastily and carried it to the window to examine it in better light the flush of excitement mounting to his very forehead is </s>
<s> am nearly sure but have book of indian botany here he took volume from the book shelves and turned the leaves with trembling fingers </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> compare it with this picture </s>
<s> it is the exact duplicate </s>
<s> this is the flower of the upas tree which usually grows only in the depths of forests and the flower fades so quickly after being plucked that it is scarcely possible to keep its form or colour even so far as the outskirts of the forest </s>
<s> yet this is in full bloom </s>
<s> where did you get these flowers he added with breathless eagerness </s>
<s> glanced at sylvie who gravely and silently laid her finger on her lips then beckoned to bruno to follow her and ran out into the garden and found myself in the position of defendant whose two most important witnesses have been suddenly taken away </s>
<s> let me give you the flowers stammered out at last quite at my wit's end as to how to get out of the difficulty </s>
<s> you know much more about them than do accept them most gratefully </s>
<s> but you have not yet told me the earl was beginning when we were interrupted to my great relief by the arrival of eric lindon </s>
<s> to arthur however the new comer was saw clearly anything but welcome </s>
<s> his face clouded over he drew little back from the circle and took no further part in the conversation which was wholly maintained for some minutes by lady muriel and her lively cousin who were discussing some new music that had just arrived from london </s>
<s> do just try this one he pleaded </s>
<s> the music looks easy to sing at sight and the song's quite appropriate to the occasion then suppose it's five o'clock tea </s>
<s> ever to thee faithful i'll be five o'clock tea laughed lady muriel as she sat down to the piano and lightly struck few random chords </s>
<s> not quite and yet it is kind of ever to thee faithful i'll be it's pair of hapless lovers he crosses the briny deep and she is left lamenting that is indeed appropriate she replied mockingly as he placed the song before her </s>
<s> and am to do the lamenting </s>
<s> and who for if you please she played the air once or twice through first in quick and finally in slow time and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease as if she had been familiar with it all her life he stept so lightly to the land all in his manly pride he kissed her cheek he pressed her hand yet still she glanced aside </s>
<s> too gay he seems she darkly dreams too gallant and too gay to think of me poor simple me when he is far away bring my love this goodly pearl across the seas he said gem to deck the dearest girl that ever sailor wed she clasps it tight her eyes are bright her throbbing heart would say he thought of me he thought of me when he was far away the ship has sailed into the west her ocean bird is flown dull dead pain is in her breast and she is weak and lone yet there's smile upon her face smile that seems to say he'll think of me he'll think of me when he is far away </s>
<s> though waters wide between us glide our lives are warm and near no distance parts two faithful hearts two hearts that love so dear and will trust my sailor lad for ever and day to think of me to think of me when he is far away the look of displeasure which had begun to come over arthur's face when the young captain spoke of love so lightly faded away as the song proceeded and he listened with evident delight </s>
<s> but his face darkened again when eric demurely remarked don't you think my soldier lad would have fitted the tune just as well why so it would lady muriel gaily retorted </s>
<s> soldiers sailors tinkers tailors what lot of words would fit in </s>
<s> think my tinker lad sounds best </s>
<s> don't you to spare my friend further pain rose to go just as the earl was beginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the flowers </s>
<s> you have not yet yes i've had some tea thank you hastily interrupted him </s>
<s> and now we really must be going </s>
<s> good evening lady muriel and we made our adieux and escaped while the earl was still absorbed in examining the mysterious bouquet </s>
<s> lady muriel accompanied us to the door </s>
<s> you couldn't have given my father more acceptable present she said warmly </s>
<s> he is so passionately fond of botany </s>
<s> i'm afraid know nothing of the theory of it but keep his hortus siccus in order </s>
<s> must get some sheets of blotting paper and dry these new treasures for him before they fade </s>
<s> that won't be no good at all said bruno who was waiting for us in the garden </s>
<s> why won't it said </s>
<s> you know had to give the flowers to stop questions </s>
<s> yes it ca'n be helped said sylvie but they will be sorry when they find them gone but how will they go well don't know how </s>
<s> but they will go </s>
<s> the nosegay was only phlizz you know </s>
<s> bruno made it up these last words were in whisper as she evidently did not wish arthur to hear </s>
<s> but of this there seemed to be little risk he hardly seemed to notice the children but paced on silent and abstracted and when at the entrance to the wood they bid us hasty farewell and ran off he seemed to wake out of day dream </s>
<s> the bouquet vanished as sylvie had predicted and when day or two afterwards arthur and once more visited the hall we found the earl and his daughter with the old housekeeper out in the garden examining the fastenings of the drawing room window </s>
<s> we are holding an inquest lady muriel said advancing to meet us and we admit you as accessories before the fact to tell us all you know about those flowers the accessories before the fact decline to answer any questions gravely replied </s>
<s> and they reserve their defence well then turn queen's evidence please </s>
<s> the flowers have disappeared in the night she went on turning to arthur and we are quite sure no one in the house has meddled with them </s>
<s> somebody must have entered by the window but the fastenings have not been tampered with said the earl </s>
<s> it must have been while you were dining my lady said the housekeeper </s>
<s> that was it said the earl </s>
<s> the thief must have seen you bring the flowers turning to me and have noticed that you did not take them away </s>
<s> and he must have known their great value they are simply priceless he exclaimed in sudden excitement </s>
<s> and you never told us how you got them said lady muriel </s>
<s> some day stammered may be free to tell you </s>
<s> just now would you excuse me the earl looked disappointed but kindly said very well we will ask no questions image five o'clock tea but we consider you very bad queen's evidence lady muriel added playfully as we entered the arbour </s>
<s> we pronounce you to be an accomplice and we sentence you to solitary confinement and to be fed on bread and butter </s>
<s> do you take sugar it is disquieting certainly she resumed when all creature comforts had been duly supplied to find that the house has been entered by thief in this out of the way place </s>
<s> if only the flowers had been eatables one might have suspected thief of quite another shape you mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances the cat did it said arthur </s>
<s> yes she replied </s>
<s> what convenient thing it would be if all thieves had the same shape </s>
<s> it's so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds and others bipeds it has occurred to me said arthur as curious problem in teleology the science of final causes he added in answer to an enquiring look from lady muriel </s>
<s> and final cause is well suppose we say the last of series of connected events each of the series being the cause of the next for whose sake the first event takes place but the last event is practically an effect of the first isn't it </s>
<s> and yet you call it cause of it arthur pondered moment </s>
<s> the words are rather confusing grant you he said </s>
<s> will this do </s>
<s> the last event is an effect of the first but the necessity for that event is cause of the necessity for the first that seems clear enough said lady muriel </s>
<s> now let us have the problem it's merely this </s>
<s> what object can we imagine in the arrangement by which each different size roughly speaking of living creatures has its special shape </s>
<s> for instance the human race has one kind of shape bipeds </s>
<s> another set ranging from the lion to the mouse are quadrupeds </s>
<s> go down step or two further and you come to insects with six legs hexapods beautiful name is it not </s>
<s> but beauty in our sense of the word seems to diminish as we go down the creature becomes more won't say ugly of any of god's creatures more uncouth </s>
<s> and when we take the microscope and go few steps lower still we come upon animalculae terribly uncouth and with terrible number of legs the other alternative said the earl would be diminuendo series of repetitions of the same type </s>
<s> never mind the monotony of it let's see how it would work in other ways </s>
<s> begin with the race of men and the creatures they require let us say horses cattle sheep and dogs we don't exactly require frogs and spiders do we muriel lady muriel shuddered perceptibly it was evidently painful subject </s>
<s> we can dispense with them she said gravely </s>
<s> well then we'll have second race of men half yard high who would have one source of exquisite enjoyment not possessed by ordinary men arthur interrupted </s>
<s> what source said the earl </s>
<s> why the grandeur of scenery </s>
<s> surely the grandeur of mountain to me depends on its size relative to me </s>
<s> double the height of the mountain and of course it's twice as grand </s>
<s> halve my height and you produce the same effect happy happy happy small lady muriel murmured rapturously </s>
<s> none but the short none but the short none but the short enjoy the tall but let me go on said the earl </s>
<s> we'll have third race of men five inches high fourth race an inch high they couldn't eat common beef and mutton i'm sure lady muriel interrupted </s>
<s> true my child was forgetting </s>
<s> each set must have its own cattle and sheep and its own vegetation added </s>
<s> what could cow an inch high do with grass that waved far above its head that is true </s>
<s> we must have pasture within pasture so to speak </s>
<s> the common grass would serve our inch high cows as green forest of palms while round the root of each tall stem would stretch tiny carpet of microscopic grass </s>
<s> yes think our scheme will work fairly well </s>
<s> and it would be very interesting coming into contact with the races below us </s>
<s> what sweet little things the inch high bull dogs would be </s>
<s> doubt if even muriel would run away from one of them don't you think we ought to have crescendo series as well said lady muriel </s>
<s> only fancy being hundred yards high </s>
<s> one could use an elephant as paper weight and crocodile as pair of scissors and would you have races of different sizes communicate with one another enquired </s>
<s> would they make war on one another for instance or enter into treaties war we must exclude think </s>
<s> when you could crush whole nation with one blow of your fist you couldn't conduct war on equal terms </s>
<s> but anything involving collision of minds only would be possible in our ideal world for of course we must allow mental powers to all irrespective of size </s>
<s> perhaps the fairest rule would be that the smaller the race the greater should be its intellectual development do you mean to say said lady muriel that these manikins of an inch high are to argue with me surely surely said the earl </s>
<s> an argument doesn't depend for its logical force on the size of the creature that utters it she tossed her head indignantly </s>
<s> would not argue with any man less than six inches high she cried </s>
<s> i'd make him work what at said arthur listening to all this nonsense with an amused smile </s>
<s> embroidery she readily replied </s>
<s> what lovely embroidery they would do yet if they did it wrong said you couldn't argue the question </s>
<s> don't know why but agree that it couldn't be done the reason is said lady muriel one couldn't sacrifice one's dignity so far of course one couldn't echoed arthur </s>
<s> any more than one could argue with potato </s>
<s> it would be altogether excuse the ancient pun infra dig doubt it said </s>
<s> even pun doesn't quite convince me well if that is not the reason said lady muriel what reason would you give tried hard to understand the meaning of this question but the persistent humming of the bees confused me and there was drowsiness in the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had got well thought out so all could say was that must depend on the weight of the potato felt the remark was not so sensible as should have liked it to be </s>
<s> but lady muriel seemed to take it quite as matter of course </s>
<s> in that case she began but suddenly started and turned away to listen </s>
<s> don't you hear him she said </s>
<s> he's crying </s>
<s> we must go to him somehow and said to myself that's very strange </s>
<s> quite thought it was lady muriel talking to me </s>
<s> why it's sylvie all the while and made another great effort to say something that should have some meaning in it </s>
<s> is it about the potato chapter </s>
<s> through the ivory door </s>
<s> don't know said sylvie </s>
<s> hush </s>
<s> must think </s>
<s> could go to him by myself well enough </s>
<s> but want you to come too let me go with you pleaded </s>
<s> can walk as fast as you can i'm sure sylvie laughed merrily </s>
<s> what nonsense she cried </s>
<s> why you ca'n walk bit </s>
<s> you're lying quite flat on your back </s>
<s> you don't understand these things can walk as well as you can repeated </s>
<s> and tried my best to walk few steps but the ground slipped away backwards quite as fast as could walk so that made no progress at all </s>
<s> sylvie laughed again </s>
<s> there told you so </s>
<s> you've no idea how funny you look moving your feet about in the air as if you were walking </s>
<s> wait bit </s>
<s> i'll ask the professor what we'd better do and she knocked at his study door </s>
<s> the door opened and the professor looked out </s>
<s> what's that crying heard just now he asked </s>
<s> is it human animal it's boy sylvie said </s>
<s> i'm afraid you've been teasing him no indeed haven't sylvie said very earnestly </s>
<s> never tease him well must ask the other professor about it he went back into the study and we heard him whispering small human animal says she hasn't been teasing him the kind that's called boy ask her which boy said new voice </s>
<s> the professor came out again </s>
<s> which boy is it that you haven't been teasing sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes </s>
<s> you dear old thing she exclaimed standing on tiptoe to kiss him while he gravely stooped to receive the salute </s>
<s> how you do puzzle me </s>
<s> why there are several boys haven't been teasing the professor returned to his friend and this time the voice said tell her to bring them here all of them ca'n and won't </s>
<s> sylvie exclaimed the moment he reappeared </s>
<s> it's bruno that's crying and he's my brother and please we both want to go he ca'n walk you know he's he's dreaming you know this in whisper for fear of hurting my feelings </s>
<s> do let's go through the ivory door i'll ask him said the professor disappearing again </s>
<s> he returned directly </s>
<s> he says you may </s>
<s> follow me and walk on tip toe the difficulty with me would have been just then not to walk on tip toe </s>
<s> it seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the floor as sylvie led me through the study </s>
<s> the professor went before us to unlock the ivory door </s>
<s> had just time to glance at the other professor who was sitting reading with his back to us before the professor showed us out through the door and locked it behind us </s>
<s> bruno was standing with his hands over his face crying bitterly </s>
<s> image what's the matter darling what's the matter darling said sylvie with her arms round his neck </s>
<s> hurted mine self welly much sobbed the poor little fellow </s>
<s> i'm so sorry darling </s>
<s> how ever did you manage to hurt yourself so course managed it said bruno laughing through his tears </s>
<s> doos oo think nobody else but oo ca'n manage things matters were looking distinctly brighter now bruno had begun to argue </s>
<s> come let's hear all about it said </s>
<s> my foot took it into its head to slip bruno began </s>
<s> foot hasn't got head sylvie put in but all in vain </s>
<s> slipted down the bank </s>
<s> and tripted over stone </s>
<s> and the stone hurted my foot </s>
<s> and trod on bee </s>
<s> and the bee stinged my finger poor bruno sobbed again </s>
<s> the complete list of woes was too much for his feelings </s>
<s> and it knewed didn't mean to trod on it he added as the climax </s>
<s> that bee should be ashamed of itself said severely and sylvie hugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried </s>
<s> my finger's quite unstung now said bruno </s>
<s> why doos there be stones </s>
<s> mister sir doos oo know they're good for something said even if we don't know what </s>
<s> what's the good of dandelions now dindledums said bruno </s>
<s> oh they're ever so pretty </s>
<s> and stones aren't pretty one bit </s>
<s> would oo like some dindledums mister sir bruno sylvie murmured reproachfully </s>
<s> you mustn't say mister and sir both at once </s>
<s> remember what told you you telled me were to say mister when spoked about him and were to say sir when spoked to him well you're not doing both you know ah but is doing bofe miss praticular bruno exclaimed triumphantly </s>
<s> wishted to speak about the gemplun and wishted to speak to the gemplun </s>
<s> so course said mister sir that's all right bruno said </s>
<s> course it's all right said bruno </s>
<s> sylvie just knows nuffin at all there never was an impertinenter boy said sylvie frowning till her bright eyes were nearly invisible </s>
<s> and there never was an ignoranter girl retorted bruno </s>
<s> come along and pick some dindledums </s>
<s> that's all she's fit for he added in very loud whisper to me </s>
<s> but why do you say dindledums bruno </s>
<s> dandelions is the right word it's because he jumps about so sylvie said laughing </s>
<s> yes that's it bruno assented </s>
<s> sylvie tells me the words and then when jump about they get shooken up in my head till they're all froth expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation </s>
<s> but aren't you going to pick me any dindledums after all course we will cried bruno </s>
<s> come along sylvie and the happy children raced away bounding over the turf with the fleetness and grace of young antelopes </s>
<s> then you didn't find your way back to outland said to the professor </s>
<s> oh yes did he replied we never got to queer street but found another way </s>
<s> i've been backwards and forwards several times since then </s>
<s> had to be present at the election you know as the author of the new money act </s>
<s> the emperor was so kind as to wish that should have the credit of it </s>
<s> let come what come may remember the very words of the imperial speech if it should turn out that the warden is alive you will bear witness that the change in the coinage is the professor's doing not mine never was so glorified in my life before tears trickled down his cheeks at the recollection which apparently was not wholly pleasant one </s>
<s> is the warden supposed to be dead well it's supposed so but mind you don't believe it </s>
<s> the evidence is very weak mere hear say </s>
<s> wandering jester with dancing bear they found their way into the palace one day has been telling people he comes from fairyland and that the warden died there </s>
<s> wanted the vice warden to question him but most unluckily he and my lady were always out walking when the jester came round </s>
<s> yes the warden's supposed to be dead and more tears trickled down the old man's cheeks </s>
<s> but what is the new money act the professor brightened up again </s>
<s> the emperor started the thing he said </s>
<s> he wanted to make everybody in outland twice as rich as he was before just to make the new government popular </s>
<s> only there wasn't nearly enough money in the treasury to do it </s>
<s> so suggested that he might do it by doubling the value of every coin and bank note in outland </s>
<s> it's the simplest thing possible </s>
<s> wonder nobody ever thought of it before </s>
<s> and you never saw such universal joy </s>
<s> the shops are full from morning to night </s>
<s> everybody's buying everything and how was the glorifying done sudden gloom overcast the professor's jolly face </s>
<s> they did it as went home after the election he mournfully replied </s>
<s> it was kindly meant but didn't like it </s>
<s> they waved flags all round me till was nearly blind and they rang bells till was nearly deaf and they strewed the road so thick with flowers that lost my way and the poor old man sighed deeply </s>
<s> how far is it to outland asked to change the subject </s>
<s> about five days march </s>
<s> but one must go back occasionally </s>
<s> you see as court professor have to be always in attendance on prince uggug </s>
<s> the empress would be very angry if left him even for an hour but surely every time you come here you are absent ten days at least oh more than that the professor exclaimed </s>
<s> fortnight sometimes </s>
<s> but of course keep memorandum of the exact time when started so that can put the court time back to the very moment excuse me said </s>
<s> don't understand silently the professor drew front his pocket square gold watch with six or eight hands and held it out for my inspection </s>
<s> this he began is an outlandish watch so should have thought which has the peculiar property that instead of its going with the time the time goes with it </s>
<s> trust you understand me now hardly said </s>
<s> permit me to explain </s>
<s> so long as it is let alone it takes its own course </s>
<s> time has no effect upon it have known such watches remarked </s>
<s> it goes of course at the usual rate </s>
<s> only the time has to go with it </s>
<s> hence if move the hands change the time </s>
<s> to move them forwards in advance of the true time is impossible but can move them as much as month backwards that is the limit </s>
<s> and then you have the events all over again with any alterations experience may suggest what blessing such watch would be thought in real life </s>
<s> to be able to unsay some heedless word to undo some reckless deed </s>
<s> might see the thing done with pleasure said the good natured professor </s>
<s> when move this hand back to here pointing out the place history goes back fifteen minutes trembling with excitement watched him push the hand round as he described </s>
<s> hurted mine self welly much shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears and more startled than cared to show turned to look for the speaker </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> there was bruno standing with the tears running down his cheeks just as had seen him quarter of an hour ago and there was sylvie with her arms round his neck </s>
<s> had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his troubles second time so hastily begged the professor to push the hands round into their former position </s>
<s> in moment sylvie and bruno were gone again and could just see them in the far distance picking dindledums wonderful indeed exclaimed </s>
<s> it has another property yet more wonderful said the professor </s>
<s> you see this little peg </s>
<s> that is called the reversal peg if you push it in the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order </s>
<s> do not try it now </s>
<s> will lend you the watch for few days and you can amuse yourself with experiments thank you very much said as he gave me the watch </s>
<s> i'll take the greatest care of it why here are the children again we could only but find six dindledums said bruno putting them into my hands cause sylvie said it were time to go back </s>
<s> and here's big blackberry for ooself </s>
<s> we couldn't only find but two thank you it's very nice said </s>
<s> and suppose you ate the other bruno no didn't bruno said carelessly </s>
<s> aren't they pretty dindledums mister sir yes very but what makes you limp so my child mine foot's come hurted again bruno mournfully replied </s>
<s> and he sat down on the ground and began nursing it </s>
<s> the professor held his head between his hands an attitude that knew indicated distraction of mind </s>
<s> better rest minute he said </s>
<s> it may be better then or it may be worse </s>
<s> if only had some of my medicines here </s>
<s> i'm court physician you know he added aside to me </s>
<s> shall go and get you some blackberries darling sylvie whispered with her arms round his neck and she kissed away tear that was trickling down his cheek </s>
<s> bruno brightened up in moment </s>
<s> that are good plan he exclaimed </s>
<s> thinks my foot would come quite unhurted if eated blackberry two or three blackberries six or seven blackberries sylvie got up hastily </s>
<s> i'd better go she said aside to me before he gets into the double figures </s>
<s> let me come and help you said </s>
<s> can reach higher up than you can </s>
<s> yes please said sylvie putting her hand into mine and we walked off together </s>
<s> bruno loves blackberries she said as we paced slowly along by tall hedge that looked promising place for them and it was so sweet of him to make me eat the only one </s>
<s> oh it was you that ate it then </s>
<s> bruno didn't seem to like to tell me about it </s>
<s> no saw that said sylvie </s>
<s> he's always afraid of being praised </s>
<s> but he made me eat it really </s>
<s> would much rather he oh what's that </s>
<s> and she clung to my hand half frightened as we came in sight of hare lying on its side with legs stretched out just in the entrance to the wood </s>
<s> it's hare my child </s>
<s> perhaps it's asleep </s>
<s> no it isn't asleep sylvie said timidly going nearer to look at it it's eyes are open </s>
<s> is it is it her voice dropped to an awestruck whisper is it dead do you think yes it's quite dead said after stooping to examine it </s>
<s> poor thing </s>
<s> think it's been hunted to death </s>
<s> know the harriers were out yesterday </s>
<s> but they haven't touched it </s>
<s> perhaps they caught sight of another and left it to die of fright and exhaustion hunted to death sylvie repeated to herself very slowly and sadly </s>
<s> thought hunting was thing they played at like game </s>
<s> bruno and hunt snails but we never hurt them when we catch them sweet angel thought </s>
<s> how am to get the idea of sport into your innocent mind and as we stood hand in hand looking down at the dead hare tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand </s>
<s> you know what fierce wild beasts lions and tigers are sylvie nodded </s>
<s> well in some countries men have to kill them to save their own lives you know yes said sylvie if one tried to kill me bruno would kill it if he could well and so the men the hunters get to enjoy it you know the running and the fighting and the shouting and the danger yes said sylvie </s>
<s> bruno likes danger well but in this country there aren't any lions and tigers loose so they hunt other creatures you see hoped but in vain that this would satisfy her and that she would ask no more questions </s>
<s> they hunt foxes sylvie said thoughtfully </s>
<s> and think they kill them too </s>
<s> foxes are very fierce </s>
<s> daresay men don't love them </s>
<s> are hares fierce no said </s>
<s> hare is sweet gentle timid animal almost as gentle as lamb but if men love hares why why her voice quivered and her sweet eyes were brimming over with tears </s>
<s> i'm afraid they don't love them dear child all children love them sylvie said </s>
<s> all ladies love them i'm afraid even ladies go to hunt them sometimes sylvie shuddered </s>
<s> oh no not ladies she earnestly pleaded </s>
<s> not lady muriel no she never does i'm sure but this is too sad sight for you dear </s>
<s> let's try and find some but sylvie was not satisfied yet </s>
<s> in hushed solemn tone with bowed head and clasped hands she put her final question </s>
<s> does god love hares yes said </s>
<s> i'm sure he does </s>
<s> he loves every living thing </s>
<s> even sinful men </s>
<s> how much more the animals that cannot sin don't know what sin means said sylvie </s>
<s> and didn't try to explain it </s>
<s> come my child said trying to lead her away </s>
<s> wish good bye to the poor hare and come and look for blackberries good bye poor hare sylvie obediently repeated looking over her shoulder at it as we turned away </s>
<s> and then all in moment her self command gave way </s>
<s> pulling her hand out of mine she ran back to where the dead hare was lying and flung herself down at its side in such an agony of grief as could hardly have believed possible in so young child </s>
<s> oh my darling my darling she moaned over and over again </s>
<s> and god meant your life to be so beautiful sometimes but always keeping her face hidden on the ground she would reach out one little hand to stroke the poor dead thing and then once more bury her face in her hands and sob as if her heart would break </s>
<s> image the dead hare was afraid she would really make herself ill still thought it best to let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief and after few minutes the sobbing gradually ceased and sylvie rose to her feet and looked calmly at me though tears were still streaming down her cheeks </s>
<s> did not dare to speak again just yet but simply held out my hand to her that we might quit the melancholy spot </s>
<s> yes i'll come now she said </s>
<s> very reverently she kneeled down and kissed the dead hare then rose and gave me her hand and we moved on in silence </s>
<s> child's sorrow is violent but short and it was almost in her usual voice that she said after minute oh stop stop </s>
<s> here are some lovely blackberries we filled our hands with fruit and returned in all haste to where the professor and bruno were seated on bank awaiting our return </s>
<s> just before we came within hearing distance sylvie checked me </s>
<s> please don't tell bruno about the hare she said </s>
<s> very well my child </s>
<s> but why not </s>
<s> tears again glittered in those sweet eyes and she turned her head away so that could scarcely hear her reply </s>
<s> he's he's very fond of gentle creatures you know </s>
<s> and he'd he'd be so sorry </s>
<s> don't want him to be made sorry and your agony of sorrow is to count for nothing then sweet unselfish child </s>
<s> thought to myself </s>
<s> but no more was said till we had reached our friends and bruno was far too much engrossed in the feast we had brought him to take any notice of sylvie's unusually grave manner </s>
<s> i'm afraid it's getting rather late professor said </s>
<s> yes indeed said the professor </s>
<s> must take you all through the ivory door again </s>
<s> you've stayed your full time mightn't we stay little longer pleaded sylvie </s>
<s> just one minute added bruno </s>
<s> but the professor was unyielding </s>
<s> it's great privilege coming through at all he said </s>
<s> we must go now and we followed him obediently to the ivory door which he threw open and signed to me to go through first </s>
<s> you're coming too aren't you said to sylvie </s>
<s> yes she said but you won't see us after you've gone through but suppose wait for you outside asked as stepped through the doorway </s>
<s> in that case said sylvie think the potato would be quite justified in asking your weight </s>
<s> can quite imagine really superior kidney potato declining to argue with any one under fifteen stone with great effort recovered the thread of my thoughts </s>
<s> we lapse very quickly into nonsense said </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> crossing the line </s>
<s> let us lapse back again said lady muriel </s>
<s> take another cup of tea </s>
<s> hope that's sound common sense and all that strange adventure thought has occupied the space of single comma in lady muriel's speech </s>
<s> single comma for which grammarians tell us to count one felt no doubt that the professor had kindly put back the time for me to the exact point at which had gone to sleep when few minutes afterwards we left the house arthur's first remark was certainly strange one </s>
<s> we've been there just twenty minutes he said and i've done nothing but listen to you and lady muriel talking and yet somehow feel exactly as if had been talking with her for an hour at least and so he had been felt no doubt only as the time had been put back to the beginning of the tete tete he referred to the whole of it had passed into oblivion if not into nothingness </s>
<s> but valued my own reputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to him what had happened </s>
<s> for some cause which could not at the moment divine arthur was unusually grave and silent during our walk home </s>
<s> it could not be connected with eric lindon thought as he had for some days been away in london so that having lady muriel almost all to himself for was only too glad to hear those two conversing to have any wish to intrude any remarks of my own he ought theoretically to have been specially radiant and contented with life </s>
<s> can he have heard any bad news said to myself </s>
<s> and almost as if he had read my thoughts he spoke </s>
<s> he will be here by the last train he said in the tone of one who is continuing conversation rather than beginning one </s>
<s> captain lindon do you mean yes captain lindon said arthur said he because fancied we were talking about him </s>
<s> the earl told me he comes tonight though to morrow is the day when he will know about the commission that he's hoping for </s>
<s> wonder he doesn't stay another day to hear the result if he's really so anxious about it as the earl believes he is he can have telegram sent after him said but it's not very soldier like running away from possible bad news he's very good fellow said arthur but confess it would be good news for me if he got his commission and his marching orders all at once </s>
<s> wish him all happiness with one exception </s>
<s> good night we had reached home by this time i'm not good company to night better be alone it was much the same next day </s>
<s> arthur declared he wasn't fit for society and had to set forth alone for an afternoon stroll </s>
<s> took the road to the station and at the point where the road from the hall joined it paused seeing my friends in the distance seemingly bound for the same goal </s>
<s> will you join us the earl said after had exchanged greetings with him and lady muriel and captain lindon </s>
<s> this restless young man is expecting telegram and we are going to the station to meet it there is also restless young woman in the case lady muriel added </s>
<s> that goes without saying my child said her father </s>
<s> women are always restless for generous appreciation of all one's best qualities his daughter impressively remarked there's nothing to compare with father is there eric cousins are not in it said eric and then somehow the conversation lapsed into two duologues the younger folk taking the lead and the two old men following with less eager steps </s>
<s> and when are we to see your little friends again said the earl </s>
<s> they are singularly attractive children shall be delighted to bring them when can said </s>
<s> but don't know myself when am likely to see them again i'm not going to question you said the earl but there's no harm in mentioning that muriel is simply tormented with curiosity </s>
<s> we know most of the people about here and she has been vainly trying to guess what house they can possibly be staying at some day may be able to enlighten her but just at present thanks </s>
<s> she must bear it as best she can </s>
<s> tell her it's grand opportunity for practising patience </s>
<s> but she hardly sees it from that point of view </s>
<s> why there are the children so indeed they were waiting for us apparently at stile which they could not have climbed over more than few moments as lady muriel and her cousin had passed it without seeing them </s>
<s> on catching sight of us bruno ran to meet us and to exhibit to us with much pride the handle of clasp knife the blade having been broken off which he had picked up in the road </s>
<s> and what shall you use it for bruno said </s>
<s> don't know bruno carelessly replied must think child's first view of life the earl remarked with that sweet sad smile of his is that it is period to be spent in accumulating portable property </s>
<s> that view gets modified as the years glide away and he held out his hand to sylvie who had placed herself by me looking little shy of him </s>
<s> but the gentle old man was not one with whom any child human or fairy could be shy for long and she had very soon deserted my hand for his bruno alone remaining faithful to his first friend </s>
<s> we overtook the other couple just as they reached the station and both lady muriel and eric greeted the children as old friends the latter with the words so you got to babylon by candlelight after all yes and back again cried bruno </s>
<s> lady muriel looked from one to the other in blank astonishment </s>
<s> what you know them eric she exclaimed </s>
<s> this mystery grows deeper every day then we must be somewhere in the third act said eric </s>
<s> you don't expect the mystery to be cleared up till the fifth act do you but it's such long drama was the plaintive reply </s>
<s> we must have got to the fifth act by this time third act assure you said the young soldier mercilessly </s>
<s> scene railway platform </s>
<s> lights down </s>
<s> enter prince in disguise of course and faithful attendant </s>
<s> this is the prince taking bruno's hand and here stands his humble servant what is your royal highness next command and he made most courtier like low bow to his puzzled little friend </s>
<s> oo're not servant bruno scornfully exclaimed </s>
<s> oo're gemplun servant assure your royal highness eric respectfully insisted </s>
<s> allow me to mention to your royal highness my various situations past present and future what did oo begin wiz bruno asked beginning to enter into the jest </s>
<s> was oo shoe black lower than that your royal highness </s>
<s> years ago offered myself as slave as confidential slave think it's called he asked turning to lady muriel </s>
<s> but lady muriel heard him not something had gone wrong with her glove which entirely engrossed her attention </s>
<s> did oo get the place said bruno </s>
<s> sad to say your royal highness did not </s>
<s> so had to take situation as as waiter which have now held for some years haven't he again glanced at lady muriel </s>
<s> sylvie dear do help me to button this glove lady muriel whispered hastily stooping down and failing to hear the question </s>
<s> and what will oo be next said bruno </s>
<s> my next place will hope be that of groom </s>
<s> and after that don't puzzle the child so lady muriel interrupted </s>
<s> what nonsense you talk after that eric persisted hope to obtain the situation of housekeeper which fourth act he proclaimed with sudden change of tone </s>
<s> lights turned up </s>
<s> red lights </s>
<s> green lights </s>
<s> distant rumble heard </s>
<s> enter passenger train and in another minute the train drew up alongside of the platform and stream of passengers began to flow out from the booking office and waiting rooms </s>
<s> did you ever make real life into drama said the earl </s>
<s> now just try </s>
<s> i've often amused myself that way </s>
<s> consider this platform as our stage </s>
<s> good entrances and exits on both sides you see </s>
<s> capital background scene real engine moving up and down </s>
<s> all this bustle and people passing to and fro must have been most carefully rehearsed </s>
<s> how naturally they do it </s>
<s> with never glance at the audience </s>
<s> and every grouping is quite fresh you see </s>
<s> no repetition it really was admirable as soon as began to enter into it from this point of view </s>
<s> even porter passing with barrow piled with luggage seemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud </s>
<s> he was followed by an angry mother with hot red face dragging along two screaming children and calling to some one behind john </s>
<s> come on enter john very meek very silent and loaded with parcels </s>
<s> and he was followed in his turn by frightened little nursemaid carrying fat baby also screaming </s>
<s> all the children screamed </s>
<s> capital byplay said the old man aside </s>
<s> did you notice the nursemaid's look of terror </s>
<s> it was simply perfect you have struck quite new vein said </s>
<s> to most of us life and its pleasures seem like mine that is nearly worked out worked out exclaimed the earl </s>
<s> for any one with true dramatic instincts it is only the overture that is ended </s>
<s> the real treat has yet to begin </s>
<s> you go to theatre and pay your ten shillings for stall and what do you get for your money </s>
<s> perhaps it's dialogue between couple of farmers unnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers dress more unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gestures most unnatural in their attempts at ease and geniality in their talk </s>
<s> go instead and take seat in third class railway carriage and you'll get the same dialogue done to the life </s>
<s> front seats no orchestra to block the view and nothing to pay which reminds me said eric </s>
<s> there is nothing to pay on receiving telegram </s>
<s> shall we enquire for one and he and lady muriel strolled off in the direction of the telegraph office </s>
<s> wonder if shakespeare had that thought in his mind said when he wrote all the world's stage the old man sighed </s>
<s> and so it is he said look at it as you will </s>
<s> life is indeed drama drama with but few encores and no bouquets he added dreamily </s>
<s> we spend one half of it in regretting the things we did in the other half and the secret of enjoying it he continued resuming his cheerful tone is intensity but not in the modern aesthetic sense presume </s>
<s> like the young lady in punch who begins conversation with are you intense by no means replied the earl </s>
<s> what mean is intensity of thought concentrated attention </s>
<s> we lose half the pleasure we might have in life by not really attending </s>
<s> take any instance you like it doesn't matter how trivial the pleasure may be the principle is the same </s>
<s> suppose and are reading the same second rate circulating library novel </s>
<s> never troubles himself to master the relationships of the characters on which perhaps all the interest of the story depends he skips over all the descriptions of scenery and every passage that looks rather dull he doesn't half attend to the passages he does read he goes on reading merely from want of resolution to find another occupation for hours after he ought to have put the book aside and reaches the finis in state of utter weariness and depression </s>
<s> puts his whole soul into the thing on the principle that whatever is worth doing is worth doing well he masters the genealogies he calls up pictures before his mind's eye as he reads about the scenery best of all he resolutely shuts the book at the end of some chapter while his interest is yet at its keenest and turns to other subjects so that when next he allows himself an hour at it it is like hungry man sitting down to dinner and when the book is finished he returns to the work of his daily life like giant refreshed but suppose the book were really rubbish nothing to repay attention well suppose it said the earl </s>
<s> my theory meets that case assure you </s>
<s> never finds out that it is rubbish but maunders on to the end trying to believe he's enjoying himself </s>
<s> quietly shuts the book when he's read dozen pages walks off to the library and changes it for better </s>
<s> have yet another theory for adding to the enjoyment of life that is if have not exhausted your patience </s>
<s> i'm afraid you find me very garrulous old man no indeed exclaimed earnestly </s>
<s> and indeed felt as if one could not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice </s>
<s> it is that we should learn to take our pleasures quickly and our pains slowly but why </s>
<s> should have put it the other way myself by taking artificial pain which can be as trivial as you please slowly the result is that when real pain comes however severe all you need do is to let it go at its ordinary pace and it's over in moment very true said but how about the pleasure why by taking it quick you can get so much more into life </s>
<s> it takes you three hours and half to hear and enjoy an opera </s>
<s> suppose can take it in and enjoy it in half an hour </s>
<s> why can enjoy seven operas while you are listening to one always supposing you have an orchestra capable of playing them said </s>
<s> and that orchestra has yet to be found the old man smiled </s>
<s> have heard an air played he said and by no means short one played right through variations and all in three seconds when </s>
<s> and how asked eagerly with half notion that was dreaming again </s>
<s> it was done by little musical box he quietly replied </s>
<s> after it had been wound up the regulator or something broke and it ran down as said in about three seconds </s>
<s> but it must have played all the notes you know did you enjoy it </s>
<s> asked with all the severity of cross examining barrister </s>
<s> no didn't he candidly confessed </s>
<s> but then you know hadn't been trained to that kind of music should much like to try your plan said and as sylvie and bruno happened to run up to us at the moment left them to keep the earl company and strolled along the platform making each person and event play its part in an extempore drama for my especial benefit </s>
<s> what is the earl tired of you already said as the children ran past me </s>
<s> no sylvie replied with great emphasis </s>
<s> he wants the evening paper </s>
<s> so bruno's going to be little news boy mind you charge good price for it called after them </s>
<s> returning up the platform came upon sylvie alone </s>
<s> well child said where's your little news boy </s>
<s> couldn't he get you an evening paper he went to get one at the book stall at the other side said sylvie and he's coming across the line with it oh bruno you ought to cross by the bridge for the distant thud thud of the express was already audible </s>
<s> suddenly look of horror came over her face </s>
<s> oh he's fallen down on the rails she cried and darted past me at speed that quite defied the hasty effort made to stop her </s>
<s> but the wheezy old station master happened to be close behind me he wasn't good for much poor old man but he was good for this and before could turn round he had the child clasped in his arms saved from the certain death she was rushing to </s>
<s> so intent was in watching this scene that hardly saw flying figure in light grey suit who shot across from the back of the platform and was on the line in another second </s>
<s> so far as one could take note of time in such moment of horror he had about ten clear seconds before the express would be upon him in which to cross the rails and to pick up bruno </s>
<s> whether he did so or not it was quite impossible to guess the next thing one knew was that the express had passed and that whether for life or death all was over </s>
<s> when the cloud of dust had cleared away and the line was once more visible we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his deliverer were safe </s>
<s> all right eric called to us cheerfully as he recrossed the line </s>
<s> he's more frightened than hurt image crossing the line he lifted the little fellow up into lady muriel's arms and mounted the platform as gaily as if nothing had happened but he was as pale as death and leaned heavily on the arm hastily offered him fearing he was about to faint </s>
<s> i'll just sit down moment he said dreamily where's sylvie sylvie ran to him and flung her arms round his neck sobbing as if her heart would break </s>
<s> don't do that my darling eric murmured with strange look in his eyes </s>
<s> nothing to cry about now you know </s>
<s> but you very nearly got yourself killed for nothing for bruno the little maiden sobbed </s>
<s> and he would have done it for me </s>
<s> wouldn't you bruno course would bruno said looking round with bewildered air </s>
<s> lady muriel kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms </s>
<s> then she beckoned sylvie to come and take his hand and signed to the children to go back to where the earl was seated </s>
<s> tell him she whispered with quivering lips tell him all is well then she turned to the hero of the day </s>
<s> thought it was death she said </s>
<s> thank god you are safe </s>
<s> did you see how near it was saw there was just time eric said lightly </s>
<s> soldier must learn to carry his life in his hand you know </s>
<s> i'm all right now </s>
<s> shall we go to the telegraph office again </s>
<s> daresay it's come by this time went to join the earl and the children and we waited almost in silence for no one seemed inclined to talk and bruno was half asleep on sylvie's lap till the others joined us </s>
<s> no telegram had come </s>
<s> i'll take stroll with the children said feeling that we were little de trop and i'll look in in the course of the evening we must go back into the wood now sylvie said as soon as we were out of hearing </s>
<s> we ca'n stay this size any longer then you will be quite tiny fairies again next time we meet yes said sylvie but we'll be children again some day if you'll let us </s>
<s> bruno's very anxious to see lady muriel again she are welly nice said bruno </s>
<s> shall be very glad to take you to see her again said </s>
<s> hadn't better give you back the professor's watch </s>
<s> it'll be too large for you to carry when you're fairies you know bruno laughed merrily </s>
<s> was glad to see he had quite recovered from the terrible scene he had gone through </s>
<s> oh no it won't he said </s>
<s> when we go small it'll go small and then it'll go straight to the professor sylvie added and you won't be able to use it anymore so you'd better use it all you can now </s>
<s> we must go small when the sun sets </s>

<s> an outlandish watch </s>
<s> as entered the little town came upon two of the fishermen's wives interchanging that last word which never was the last and it occurred to me as an experiment with the magic watch to wait till the little scene was over and then to encore it </s>
<s> well good night t'ye </s>
<s> and ye winna forget to send us word when your martha writes nay ah winna forget </s>
<s> an if she isn't suited she can but coom back </s>
<s> good night t'ye casual observer might have thought and there ends the dialogue that casual observer would have been mistaken </s>
<s> ah she'll like em war'n ye </s>
<s> they'll not treat her bad yer may depend </s>
<s> they're varry canny fowk </s>
<s> good night ay they are that </s>
<s> good night good night </s>
<s> and ye'll send us word if she writes aye ah will yer may depend </s>
<s> good night t'ye and at last they parted </s>
<s> waited till they were some twenty yards apart and then put the watch minute back </s>
<s> the instantaneous change was startling the two figures seemed to flash back into their former places </s>
<s> isn't suited she can but coom back </s>
<s> good night t'ye one of them was saying and so the whole dialogue was repeated and when they had parted for the second time let them go their several ways and strolled on through the town </s>
<s> but the real usefulness of this magic power thought would be to undo some harm some painful event some accident had not long to wait for an opportunity of testing this property also of the magic watch for even as the thought passed through my mind the accident was imagining occurred </s>
<s> light cart was standing at the door of the great millinery depot of elveston laden with card board packing cases which the driver was carrying into the shop one by one </s>
<s> one of the cases had fallen into the street but it scarcely seemed worth while to step forward and pick it up as the man would be back again in moment </s>
<s> yet in that moment young man riding bicycle came sharp round the corner of the street and in trying to avoid running over the box upset his machine and was thrown headlong against the wheel of the spring cart </s>

<s> was passing pretty little villa which stood rather back from the road in its own grounds with bright flower beds in front creepers wandering over the walls and hanging in festoons about the bow windows an easy chair forgotten on the lawn with newspaper lying near it small pug dog couchant before it resolved to guard the treasure even at the sacrifice of life and front door standing invitingly half open </s>
<s> here is my chance thought for testing the reverse action of the magic watch pressed the reversal peg and walked in </s>
<s> in another house the entrance of stranger might cause surprise perhaps anger even going so far as to expel the said stranger with violence but here knew nothing of the sort could happen </s>

<s> they would first wonder who was then see me then look down and think no more about me </s>
<s> and as to being expelled with violence that event would necessarily come first in this case </s>
<s> so if can once get in said to myself all risk of expulsion will be over image the pug dog sat up the pug dog sat up as precautionary measure as passed but as took no notice of the treasure he was guarding he let me go by without even one remonstrant bark </s>
<s> he that takes my life he seemed to be saying wheezily to himself takes trash but he that takes the daily telegraph but this awful contingency did not face </s>
<s> the party in the drawing room had walked straight in you understand without ringing the bell or giving any notice of my approach consisted of four laughing rosy children of ages from about fourteen down to ten who were apparently all coming towards the door found they were really walking backwards while their mother seated by the fire with some needlework on her lap was saying just as entered the room now girls you may get your things on for walk to my utter astonishment for was not yet accustomed to the action of the watch all smiles ceased as browning says on the four pretty faces and they all got out pieces of needle work and sat down </s>
<s> no one noticed me in the least as quietly took chair and sat down to watch them </s>
<s> when the needle work had been unfolded and they were all ready to begin their mother said come that's done at last </s>
<s> you may fold up your work girls but the children took no notice whatever of the remark on the contrary they set to work at once sewing if that is the proper word to describe an operation such as had never before witnessed </s>
<s> each of them threaded her needle with short end of thread attached to the work which was instantly pulled by an invisible force through the stuff dragging the needle after it the nimble fingers of the little sempstress caught it at the other side but only to lose it again the next moment </s>
<s> and so the work went on steadily undoing itself and the neatly stitched little dresses or whatever they were steadily falling to pieces </s>
<s> now and then one of the children would pause as the recovered thread became inconveniently long wind it on bobbin and start again with another short end </s>
<s> at last all the work was picked to pieces and put away and the lady led the way into the next room walking backwards and making the insane remark not yet dear we must get the sewing done first after which was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after her exclaiming oh mother it is such lovely day for walk in the dining room the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes on it </s>
<s> however the party with the addition of gentleman as good natured and as rosy as the children seated themselves at it very contentedly </s>

<s> but to you hypercritical reader resolute to believe no item of this weird adventure what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the spit and slowly unroasted how the potatoes were wrapped in their skins and handed over to the gardener to be buried how when the mutton had at length attained to rawness the fire which had gradually changed from red heat to mere blaze died down so suddenly that the cook had only just time to catch its last flicker on the end of match or how the maid having taken the mutton off the spit carried it backwards of course out of the house to meet the butcher who was coming also backwards down the road </s>
<s> the longer thought over this strange adventure the more hopelessly tangled the mystery became and it was real relief to meet arthur in the road and get him to go with me up to the hall to learn what news the telegraph had brought </s>

<s> the earl was sitting alone when we entered </s>

<s> oh had forgotten it came in after you left the station </s>
<s> yes it's all right eric has got his commission and now that he has arranged matters with muriel he has business in town that must be seen to at once what arrangement do you mean asked with sinking heart as the thought of arthur's crushed hopes came to my mind </s>
<s> do you mean that they are engaged they have been engaged in sense for two years the old man gently replied that is he has had my promise to consent to it so soon as he could secure permanent and settled line in life </s>
<s> could never be happy with my child married to man without an object to live for without even an object to die for hope they will be happy strange voice said </s>
<s> the speaker was evidently in the room but had not heard the door open and looked round in some astonishment </s>
<s> the earl seemed to share my surprise </s>
<s> who spoke he exclaimed </s>
<s> it was said arthur looking at us with worn haggard face and eyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded </s>
<s> and let me wish you joy also dear friend he added looking sadly at the earl and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so much </s>
<s> thank you the old man said simply and heartily </s>
<s> silence followed then rose feeling sure that arthur would wish to be alone and bade our gentle host good night arthur took his hand but said nothing nor did he speak again as we went home till we were in the house and had lit our bed room candles </s>
<s> then he said more to himself than to me the heart knoweth its own bitterness </s>
<s> never understood those words till now the next few days passed wearily enough </s>
<s> felt no inclination to call by myself at the hall still less to propose that arthur should go with me it seemed better to wait till time that gentle healer of our bitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock of the disappointment that had blighted his life </s>

<s> but hope to run down again in month added </s>

<s> the frogs birthday treat </s>
<s> and so it came to pass that just week after the day when my fairy friends first appeared as children found myself taking farewell stroll through the wood in the hope of meeting them once more </s>
<s> had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf and the eerie feeling was on me in moment </s>
<s> put oor ear welly low down said bruno and i'll tell oo secret </s>
<s> it's the frogs birthday treat and we've lost the baby what baby said quite bewildered by this complicated piece of news </s>
<s> the queen's baby course said bruno </s>
<s> titania's baby </s>
<s> and we's welly sorry </s>
<s> sylvie she's oh so sorry how sorry is she asked mischievously </s>
<s> three quarters of yard bruno replied with perfect solemnity </s>
<s> and i'm little sorry too he added shutting his eyes so as not to see that he was smiling </s>
<s> and what are you doing about the baby well the soldiers are all looking for it up and down everywhere the soldiers exclaimed </s>
<s> yes course said bruno </s>
<s> when there's no fighting to be done the soldiers doos any little odd jobs oo know was amused at the idea of its being little odd job to find the royal baby </s>
<s> but how did you come to lose it asked </s>
<s> we put it in flower sylvie who had just joined us explained with her eyes full of tears </s>
<s> only we ca'n remember which she says us put it in flower bruno interrupted cause she doosn't want to get punished </s>
<s> but it were really me what put it there </s>
<s> sylvie were picking dindledums image the queen's baby you shouldn't say us put it in flower sylvie very gravely remarked </s>
<s> well hus then said bruno </s>
<s> never can remember those horrid h's let me help you to look for it said </s>
<s> so sylvie and made voyage of discovery among all the flowers but there was no baby to be seen </s>
<s> what's become of bruno said when we had completed our tour </s>
<s> he's down in the ditch there said sylvie amusing young frog went down on my hands and knees to look for him for felt very curious to know how young frogs ought to be amused </s>
<s> after minute's search found him sitting at the edge of the ditch by the side of the little frog and looking rather disconsolate </s>
<s> how are you getting on bruno said nodding to him as he looked up </s>
<s> ca'n amuse it no more bruno answered very dolefully cause it won't say what it would like to do next </s>
<s> i've showed it all the duck weeds and live caddis worm but it won't say nuffin </s>
<s> what would oo like he shouted into the ear of the frog but the little creature sat quite still and took no notice of him </s>
<s> it's deaf think bruno said turning away with sigh </s>
<s> and it's time to get the theatre ready who are the audience to be only but frogs said bruno </s>
<s> but they haven't comed yet </s>
<s> they wants to be drove up like sheep would it save time suggested if were to walk round with sylvie to drive up the frogs while you get the theatre ready that are good plan cried bruno </s>
<s> but where are sylvie i'm here said sylvie peeping over the edge of the bank </s>
<s> was just watching two frogs that were having race which won it </s>
<s> bruno eagerly inquired </s>
<s> sylvie was puzzled </s>
<s> he does ask such hard questions she confided to me </s>
<s> and what's to happen in the theatre asked </s>
<s> first they have their birthday feast sylvie said then bruno does some bits of shakespeare then he tells them story should think the frogs like the feast best </s>
<s> don't they well there's generally very few of them that get any </s>
<s> they will keep their mouths shut so tight </s>
<s> and it's just as well they do she added because bruno likes to cook it himself and he cooks very queerly now they're all in </s>
<s> would you just help me to put them with their heads the right way we soon managed this part of the business though the frogs kept up most discontented croaking all the time </s>
<s> what are they saying asked sylvie </s>
<s> they're saying fork </s>
<s> fork it's very silly of them </s>
<s> you're not going to have forks she announced with some severity </s>
<s> those that want any feast have just got to open their mouths and bruno ll put some of it in at this moment bruno appeared wearing little white apron to show that he was cook and carrying tureen full of very queer looking soup </s>
<s> watched very carefully as he moved about among the frogs but could not see that any of them opened their mouths to be fed except one very young one and i'm nearly sure it did it accidentally in yawning </s>
<s> however bruno instantly put large spoonful of soup into its mouth and the poor little thing coughed violently for some time </s>
<s> so sylvie and had to share the soup between us and to pretend to enjoy it for it certainly was very queerly cooked </s>
<s> only ventured to take one spoonful of it sylvie's summer soup bruno said it was and must candidly confess that it was not at all nice and could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept their mouths shut up tight </s>
<s> what's the soup made of bruno said sylvie who had put spoonful of it to her lips and was making wry face over it </s>
<s> and bruno's answer was anything but encouraging </s>
<s> bits of things the entertainment was to conclude with bits of shakespeare as sylvie expressed it which were all to be done by bruno sylvie being fully engaged in making the frogs keep their heads towards the stage after which bruno was to appear in his real character and tell them story of his own invention </s>
<s> will the story have moral to it asked sylvie while bruno was away behind the hedge dressing for the first bit think so sylvie replied doubtfully </s>
<s> there generally is moral only he puts it in too soon and will he say all the bits of shakespeare no he'll only act them said sylvie </s>
<s> he knows hardly any of the words </s>
<s> when see what he's dressed like i've to tell the frogs what character it is </s>
<s> they're always in such hurry to guess </s>
<s> don't you hear them all saying what </s>
<s> what and so indeed they were it had only sounded like croaking till sylvie explained it but could now make out the wawt </s>
<s> wawt quite distinctly </s>
<s> but why do they try to guess it before they see it don't know sylvie said but they always do </s>
<s> sometimes they begin guessing weeks and weeks before the day so now when you hear the frogs croaking in particularly melancholy way you may be sure they're trying to guess bruno's next shakespeare bit </s>
<s> isn't that interesting however the chorus of guessing was cut short by bruno who suddenly rushed on from behind the scenes and took flying leap down among the frogs to re arrange them </s>
<s> for the oldest and fattest frog who had never been properly arranged so that he could see the stage and so had no idea what was going on was getting restless and had upset several of the frogs and turned others round with their heads the wrong way </s>
<s> and it was no good at all bruno said to do bit of shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it you see he didn't count me as anybody </s>
<s> so he set to work with stick stirring them up very much as you would stir up tea in cup till most of them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage </s>
<s> oo must come and sit among them sylvie he said in despair i've put these two side by side with their noses the same way ever so many times but they do squarrel so so sylvie took her place as mistress of the ceremonies and bruno vanished again behind the scenes to dress for the first bit hamlet was suddenly proclaimed in the clear sweet tones knew so well </s>
<s> the croaking all ceased in moment and turned to the stage in some curiosity to see what bruno's ideas were as to the behaviour of shakespeare's greatest character </s>
<s> according to this eminent interpreter of the drama hamlet wore short black cloak which he chiefly used for muffling up his face as if he suffered good deal from toothache and turned out his toes very much as he walked </s>
<s> to be or not to be hamlet remarked in cheerful tone and then turned head over heels several times his cloak dropping off in the performance </s>
<s> felt little disappointed bruno's conception of the part seemed so wanting in dignity </s>
<s> won't he say any more of the speech whispered to sylvie </s>
<s> think not sylvie whispered in reply </s>
<s> he generally turns head over heels when he doesn't know any more words bruno had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage and the frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next character </s>
<s> you'll know directly cried sylvie as she adjusted two or three young frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage </s>
<s> macbeth she added as bruno re appeared </s>
<s> macbeth had something twisted round him that went over one shoulder and under the other arm and was meant believe for scotch plaid </s>
<s> he had thorn in his hand which he held out at arm's length as if he were little afraid of it </s>
<s> is this dagger macbeth inquired in puzzled sort of tone and instantly chorus of thorn </s>
<s> thorn arose from the frogs had quite learned to understand their croaking by this time </s>
<s> it's dagger sylvie proclaimed in peremptory tone </s>
<s> hold your tongues and the croaking ceased at once </s>
<s> shakespeare has not told us so far as know that macbeth had any such eccentric habit as turning head over heels in private life but bruno evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character and left the stage in series of somersaults </s>
<s> however he was back again in few moments having tucked under his chin the end of tuft of wool probably left on the thorn by wandering sheep which made magnificent beard that reached nearly down to his feet </s>
<s> shylock sylvie proclaimed </s>
<s> no beg your pardon she hastily corrected herself king lear </s>
<s> hadn't noticed the crown bruno had very cleverly provided one which fitted him exactly by cutting out the centre of dandelion to make room for his head king lear folded his arms to the imminent peril of his beard and said in mild explanatory tone ay every inch king and then paused as if to consider how this could best be proved </s>
<s> and here with all possible deference to bruno as shakespearian critic must express my opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely alike in their personal habits nor do believe that he would have accepted the faculty of turning head over heels as any proof at all of royal descent </s>
<s> yet it appeared that king lear after deep meditation could think of no other argument by which to prove his kingship and as this was the last of the bits of shakespeare we never do more than three sylvie explained in whisper bruno gave the audience quite long series of somersaults before he finally retired leaving the enraptured frogs all crying out more </s>
<s> more which suppose was their way of encoring performance </s>
<s> but bruno wouldn't appear again till the proper time came for telling the story </s>
<s> image the frogs birthday treat when he appeared at last in his real character noticed remarkable change in his behaviour </s>
<s> he tried no more somersaults </s>
<s> it was clearly his opinion that however suitable the habit of turning head over heels might be to such petty individuals as hamlet and king lear it would never do for bruno to sacrifice his dignity to such an extent </s>
<s> but it was equally clear that he did not feel entirely at his ease standing all alone on the stage with no costume to disguise him and though he began several times there were mouse he kept glancing up and down and on all sides as if in search of more comfortable quarters from which to tell the story </s>
<s> standing on one side of the stage and partly overshadowing it was tall foxglove which seemed as the evening breeze gently swayed it hither and thither to offer exactly the sort of accommodation that the orator desired </s>
<s> having once decided on his quarters it needed only second or two for him to run up the stem like tiny squirrel and to seat himself astride on the topmost bend where the fairy bells clustered most closely and from whence he could look down on his audience from such height that all shyness vanished and he began his story merrily </s>
<s> once there were mouse and crocodile and man and goat and lion had never heard the dramatis personae tumbled into story with such profusion and in such reckless haste and it fairly took my breath away </s>
<s> even sylvie gave little gasp and allowed three of the frogs who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment to hop away into the ditch without attempting to stop them </s>
<s> and the mouse found shoe and it thought it were mouse trap </s>
<s> so it got right in and it stayed in ever so long why did it stay in said sylvie </s>
<s> her function seemed to be much the same as that of the chorus in greek play she had to encourage the orator and draw him out by series of intelligent questions </s>
<s> cause it thought it couldn't get out again bruno explained </s>
<s> it were clever mouse </s>
<s> it knew it couldn't get out of traps but why did it go in at all said sylvie </s>
<s> and it jamp and it jamp bruno proceeded ignoring this question and at last it got right out again </s>
<s> and it looked at the mark in the shoe </s>
<s> and the man's name were in it </s>
<s> so it knew it wasn't its own shoe had it thought it was said sylvie </s>
<s> why didn't tell oo it thought it were mouse trap the indignant orator replied </s>
<s> please mister sir will oo make sylvie attend sylvie was silenced and was all attention in fact she and were most of the audience now as the frogs kept hopping away and there were very few of them left </s>
<s> so the mouse gave the man his shoe </s>
<s> and the man were welly glad cause he hadn't got but one shoe and he were hopping to get the other here ventured on question </s>
<s> do you mean hopping or hoping bofe said bruno </s>
<s> and the man took the goat out of the sack we haven't heard of the sack before said </s>
<s> nor you won't hear of it again said bruno </s>
<s> and he said to the goat oo will walk about here till comes back and he went and he tumbled into deep hole </s>
<s> and the goat walked round and round </s>
<s> and it walked under the tree </s>
<s> and it wug its tail </s>
<s> and it looked up in the tree </s>
<s> and it sang sad little song </s>
<s> oo never heard such sad little song can you sing it bruno asked </s>
<s> iss can bruno readily replied </s>
<s> and sa'n </s>
<s> it would make sylvie cry it wouldn't sylvie interrupted in great indignation </s>
<s> and don't believe the goat sang it at all it did though said bruno </s>
<s> it singed it right froo </s>
<s> sawed it singing with its long beard it couldn't sing with its beard said hoping to puzzle the little fellow beard isn't voice well then oo couldn't walk with sylvie bruno cried triumphantly </s>
<s> sylvie isn't foot thought had better follow sylvie's example and be silent for while </s>
<s> bruno was too sharp for us </s>
<s> and when it had singed all the song it ran away for to get along to look for the man oo know </s>
<s> and the crocodile got along after it for to bite it oo know </s>
<s> and the mouse got along after the crocodile wasn't the crocodile running sylvie enquired </s>
<s> she appealed to me </s>
<s> crocodiles do run don't they suggested crawling as the proper word </s>
<s> he wasn't running said bruno and he wasn't crawling </s>
<s> he went struggling along like portmanteau </s>
<s> and he held his chin ever so high in the air what did he do that for said sylvie </s>
<s> cause he hadn't got toofache said bruno </s>
<s> ca'n oo make out nuffin wizout splain it </s>
<s> why if he'd had toofache course he'd have held his head down like this and he'd have put lot of warm blankets round it if he'd had any blankets sylvie argued </s>
<s> course he had blankets retorted her brother </s>
<s> doos oo think crocodiles goes walks wizout blankets </s>
<s> and he frowned with his eyebrows </s>
<s> and the goat was welly flightened at his eyebrows i'd never be afraid of eyebrows exclaimed sylvie </s>
<s> should think oo would though if they'd got crocodile fastened to them like these had </s>
<s> and so the man jamp and he jamp and at last he got right out of the hole sylvie gave another little gasp this rapid dodging about among the characters of the story had taken away her breath </s>
<s> and he runned away for to look for the goat oo know </s>
<s> and he heard the lion grunting lions don't grunt said sylvie </s>
<s> this one did said bruno </s>
<s> and its mouth were like large cupboard </s>
<s> and it had plenty of room in its mouth </s>
<s> and the lion runned after the man for to eat him oo know </s>
<s> and the mouse runned after the lion but the mouse was running after the crocodile said he couldn't run after both bruno sighed over the density of his audience but explained very patiently </s>
<s> he did runned after bofe cause they went the same way </s>
<s> and first he caught the crocodile and then he didn't catch the lion </s>
<s> and when he'd caught the crocodile what doos oo think he did cause he'd got pincers in his pocket ca'n guess said sylvie </s>
<s> image he wrenched out that crocodile's toof nobody couldn't guess it bruno cried in high glee </s>
<s> why he wrenched out that crocodile's toof which tooth ventured to ask </s>
<s> but bruno was not to be puzzled </s>
<s> the toof he were going to bite the goat with course he couldn't be sure about that argued unless he wrenched out all its teeth bruno laughed merrily and half sang as he swung himself backwards and forwards he did wrenched out all its teef why did the crocodile wait to have them wrenched out said sylvie </s>
<s> it had to wait said bruno </s>
<s> ventured on another question </s>
<s> but what became of the man who said you may wait here till come back he didn't say oo may bruno explained </s>
<s> he said oo will just like sylvie says to me oo will do oor lessons till twelve o'clock oh wiss he added with little sigh wiss sylvie would say oo may do oor lessons this was dangerous subject for discussion sylvie seemed to think </s>
<s> she returned to the story </s>
<s> but what became of the man well the lion springed at him </s>
<s> but it came so slow it were three weeks in the air did the man wait for it all that time said </s>
<s> course he didn't bruno replied gliding head first down the stem of the fox glove for the story was evidently close to its end </s>
<s> he sold his house and he packed up his things while the lion were coming </s>
<s> and he went and he lived in another town </s>
<s> so the lion ate the wrong man this was evidently the moral so sylvie made her final proclamation to the frogs </s>
<s> the story's finished </s>
<s> and whatever is to be learned from it she added aside to me i'm sure don't know did not feel quite clear about it myself so made no suggestion but the frogs seemed quite content moral or no moral and merely raised husky chorus of off </s>
<s> off as they hopped away </s>
<s> chapter </s>
<s> looking eastward </s>
<s> it's just week said three days later to arthur since we heard of lady muriel's engagement </s>
<s> think ought to call at any rate and offer my congratulations </s>
<s> won't you come with me pained expression passed over his face </s>
<s> when must you leave us he asked </s>
<s> by the first train on monday well yes will come with you </s>
<s> it would seem strange and unfriendly if didn't </s>
<s> but this is only friday </s>
<s> give me till sunday afternoon </s>
<s> shall be stronger then shading his eyes with one hand as if half ashamed of the tears that were coursing down his cheeks he held the other out to me </s>
<s> it trembled as clasped it </s>
<s> tried to frame some words of sympathy but they seemed poor and cold and left them unspoken </s>
<s> good night was all said </s>
<s> good night dear friend he replied </s>
<s> there was manly vigour in his tone that convinced me he was wrestling with and triumphing over the great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his life and that on the stepping stone of his dead self he would surely rise to higher things </s>
<s> there was no chance was glad to think as we set out on sunday afternoon of meeting eric at the hall as he had returned to town the day after his engagement was announced </s>
<s> his presence might have disturbed the calm the almost unnatural calm with which arthur met the woman who had won his heart and murmured the few graceful words of sympathy that the occasion demanded </s>
<s> lady muriel was perfectly radiant with happiness sadness could not live in the light of such smile and even arthur brightened under it and when she remarked you see i'm watering my flowers though it is the sabbath day his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he replied even on the sabbath day works of mercy are allowed </s>
<s> but this isn't the sabbath day </s>
<s> the sabbath day has ceased to exist know it's not saturday lady muriel replied but isn't sunday often called the christian sabbath it is so called think in recognition of the spirit of the jewish institution that one day in seven should be day of rest </s>
<s> but hold that christians are freed from the literal observance of the fourth commandment then where is our authority for sunday observance we have first the fact that the seventh day was sanctified when god rested from the work of creation </s>
<s> that is binding on us as theists </s>
<s> secondly we have the fact that the lord's day is christian institution </s>
<s> that is binding on us as christians and your practical rules would be first as theists to keep it holy in some special way and to make it so far as is reasonably possible day of rest </s>
<s> secondly as christians to attend public worship and what of amusements would say of them as of all kinds of work whatever is innocent on week day is innocent on sunday provided it does not interfere with the duties of the day then you would allow children to play on sunday certainly should </s>

<s> on sunday mustn't run on the sands </s>
<s> on sunday mustn't dig in the garden poor child </s>
<s> she had indeed abundant cause for hating sunday here is the letter said lady muriel returning </s>
<s> let me read you piece of it when as child first opened my eyes on sunday morning feeling of dismal anticipation which began at least on the friday culminated </s>
<s> knew what was before me and my wish if not my word was would god it were evening it was no day of rest but day of texts of catechisms watts of tracts about converted swearers godly charwomen and edifying deaths of sinners saved </s>
<s> up with the lark hymns and portions of scripture had to be learned by heart till o'clock when there were family prayers then breakfast which was never able to enjoy partly from the fast already undergone and partly from the outlook dreaded </s>
<s> at came sunday school and it made me indignant to be put into the class with the village children as well as alarmed lest by some mistake of mine should be put below them </s>
<s> the church service was veritable wilderness of zin </s>
<s> wandered in it pitching the tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the square family pew the fidgets of my small brothers and the horror of knowing that on the monday should have to write out from memory jottings of the rambling disconnected extempore sermon which might have had any text but its own and to stand or fall by the result </s>
<s> this was followed by cold dinner at servants to have no work sunday school again from to and evening service at </s>
<s> the intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all from the efforts had to make to be less than usually sinful by reading books and sermons as barren as the dead sea </s>
<s> there was but one rosy spot in the distance all that day and that was bed time which never could come too early such teaching was well meant no doubt said arthur but it must have driven many of its victims into deserting the church services altogether i'm afraid was deserter this morning she gravely said </s>
<s> had to write to eric </s>
<s> would you would you mind my telling you something he said about prayer </s>
<s> it had never struck me in that light before in what light said arthur </s>
<s> why that all nature goes by fixed regular laws science has proved that </s>
<s> so that asking god to do anything except of course praying for spiritual blessings is to expect miracle and we've no right to do that </s>
<s> i've not put it as well as he did but that was the outcome of it and it has confused me </s>
<s> please tell me what you can say in answer to it don't propose to discuss captain lindon's difficulties arthur gravely replied specially as he is not present </s>
<s> but if it is your difficulty his voice unconsciously took tenderer tone then will speak it is my difficulty she said anxiously </s>
<s> then will begin by asking why did you except spiritual blessings is not your mind part of nature yes but free will comes in there can choose this or that and god can influence my choice then you are not fatalist oh no she earnestly exclaimed </s>
<s> thank god arthur said to himself but in so low whisper that only heard it </s>
<s> you grant then that can by an act of free choice move this cup suiting the action to the word this way or that way yes grant it well let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws </s>
<s> the cup moves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my hand </s>
<s> my hand moves because certain forces electric magnetic or whatever nerve force may prove to be are impressed on it by my brain </s>
<s> this nerve force stored in the brain would probably be traceable if science were complete to chemical forces supplied to the brain by the blood and ultimately derived from the food eat and the air breathe but would not that be fatalism </s>
<s> where would free will come in in choice of nerves replied arthur </s>
<s> the nerve force in the brain may flow just as naturally down one nerve as down another </s>
<s> we need something more than fixed law of nature to settle which nerve shall carry it </s>
<s> that something is free will her eyes sparkled see what you mean she exclaimed </s>
<s> human free will is an exception to the system of fixed law </s>
<s> eric said something like that </s>
<s> and then think he pointed out that god can only influence nature by influencing human wills </s>
<s> so that we might reasonably pray give us this day our daily bread because many of the causes that produce bread are under man's control </s>
<s> but to pray for rain or fine weather would be as unreasonable as she checked herself as if fearful of saying something irreverent </s>
<s> in hushed low tone that trembled with emotion and with the solemnity of one in the presence of death arthur slowly replied shalt he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him </s>
<s> shall we the swarm that in the noontide beam were born feeling in ourselves the power to direct this way or that the forces of nature of nature of which we form so trivial part shall we in our boundless arrogance in our pitiful conceit deny that power to the ancient of days </s>

<s> </s>
<s> in book chapter ii have adopted new definition of classification which enables me to regard the whole universe as class and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase set of things in the chapter on propositions of existence have adopted new normal form in which the class whose existence is affirmed or denied is regarded as the predicate instead of the subject of the proposition thus evading very subtle difficulty which besets the other form </s>
<s> these subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every tree of knowledge and they are far more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches </s>
<s> for example the difficulties of the forty seventh proposition of euclid are mere child's play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of straight line </s>
<s> and in the present work the difficulties of the liars problem at </s>
<s> are trifles light as air compared with the bewildering question what is thing in the chapter on propositions of relation have inserted new section containing the proof that proposition beginning with all is double proposition fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule laid down in the next section that such proposition is to be understood as implying the actual existence of its subject </s>
<s> this proof was given in the earlier editions incidentally in the course of the discussion of the biliteral diagram but its proper place in this treatise is where have now introduced it </s>
<s> pg ix in the sorites examples have made good many verbal alterations in order to evade difficulty which fear will have perplexed some of the readers of the first three editions </s>
<s> some of the premisses were so worded that their terms were not specieses of the univ </s>
<s> named in the dictionary but of larger class of which the univ </s>
<s> was only portion </s>
<s> in all such cases it was intended that the reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger class was thereby asserted of the univ and should ignore as superfluous all that it asserted of its other portion </s>
<s> thus in ex </s>
<s> the univ </s>
<s> was stated to be ducks in this village and the third premiss was mrs bond has no gray ducks </s>
<s> no gray ducks are ducks belonging to mrs bond here the terms are not specieses of the univ but of the larger class ducks of which the univ </s>
<s> is only portion and it was intended that the reader should perceive that what is here asserted of ducks is thereby asserted of ducks in this village and should treat this premiss as if it were mrs bond has no gray ducks in this village and should ignore as superfluous what it asserts as to the other portion of the class ducks viz </s>
<s> mrs bond has no gray ducks out of this village </s>
<s> in the appendix have given new version of the problem of the five liars my object in doing so is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding proposition as being its own subject or set of propositions as being subjects for one another </s>
<s> it is certainly most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory one cannot help feeling that there is great lack of substance in all this shadowy host that as the procession of phantoms glides before us there is not one that we can pounce upon and say here is proposition that must be either true or false that it is but barmecide feast to which we have been bidden and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island whose inhabitants earned precarious living by taking in each others washing </s>
<s> by simply translating telling truths into taking both of condiments salt and mustard telling lies into taking neither of them and telling truth and lie order not specified into taking only one condiment it is not specified which have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles and have produced problem which when translated into set of symbolized premisses furnishes the very same data as were furnished by the problem of the five liars pg the coined words introduced in previous editions such as eliminands and retinends perhaps hardly need any apology they were indispensable to my system but the new plural here used for the first time viz </s>
<s> soriteses will fear be condemned as bad english unless say word in its defence </s>
<s> we have three singular nouns in english of plural form series species and sorites in all three the awkwardness of using the same word for both singular and plural must often have been felt this has been remedied in the case of series by coining the plural serieses which has already found its way into the dictionaries so am no rash innovator but am merely following suit in using the new plural soriteses </s>
<s> in conclusion let me point out that even those who are obliged to study formal logic with view to being able to answer examination papers in that subject will find the study of symbolic logic most helpful for this purpose in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which formal logic abounds and in furnishing delightfully easy method of testing the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which formal logic enforces upon its votaries </s>
<s> this is believe the very first attempt with the exception of my own little book the game of logic published in very incomplete performance that has been made to popularise this fascinating subject </s>
<s> it has cost me years of hard work but if it should prove as hope it may to be of real service to the young and to be taken up in high schools and in private families as valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations such result would more than repay ten times the labour that have expended on it </s>

<s> the learner who wishes to try the question fairly whether this little book does or does not supply the materials for most interesting mental recreation is earnestly advised to adopt the following rules begin at the beginning and do not allow yourself to gratify mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book here and there </s>
<s> this would very likely lead to your throwing it aside with the remark this is much too hard for me and thus losing the chance of adding very large item to your stock of mental delights </s>
<s> this rule of not dipping is very desirable with other kinds of books such as novels for instance where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story by dipping into it further on so that what the author meant to be pleasant surprise comes to you as matter of course </s>
<s> some people know make practice of looking into vol </s>
<s> iii first just to see how the story ends and perhaps it is as well just to know that all ends happily that the much persecuted lovers do marry after all that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves and that the rich uncle in india qu why in india </s>
<s> ans because somehow uncles never can get rich anywhere else dies at exactly the right moment before taking the trouble to read vol </s>
<s> </s>
<s> this say is just permissible with novel where vol </s>
<s> iii has meaning even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story but with scientific book it is sheer insanity you will find the latter part hopelessly unintelligible if you read it before reaching it in regular course </s>
<s> pg xii don't begin any fresh chapter or section until you are certain that you thoroughly understand the whole book up to that point and that you have worked correctly most if not all of the examples which have been set </s>
<s> so long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely conquered and that you are leaving no unsolved difficulties behind you which will be sure to turn up again later on your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful </s>
<s> otherwise you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as you proceed till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust </s>
<s> when you come to any passage you don't understand read it again if you still don't understand it read it again if you fail even after three readings very likely your brain is getting little tired </s>
<s> in that case put the book away and take to other occupations and next day when you come to it fresh you will very likely find that it is quite easy </s>
<s> if possible find some genial friend who will read the book along with you and will talk over the difficulties with you </s>
<s> talking is wonderful smoother over of difficulties </s>
<s> when come upon anything in logic or in any other hard subject that entirely puzzles me find it capital plan to talk it over aloud even when am all alone </s>
<s> one can explain things so clearly to one's self </s>
<s> and then you know one is so patient with one's self one never gets irritated at one's own stupidity </s>
<s> if dear reader you will faithfully observe these rules and so give my little book really fair trial promise you most confidently that you will find symbolic logic to be one of the most if not the most fascinating of mental recreations </s>
<s> in this first part have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of say twelve or fourteen years of age </s>
<s> have myself taught most of its contents viv voce to many children and have found them take real intelligent interest in the subject </s>
<s> for those who succeed in mastering part and who begin like oliver asking for more hope to provide in part ii some tolerably hard nuts to crack nuts that will require all the nut crackers they happen to possess </s>

<s> but after all when you have made yourself first rate player at any one of these games you have nothing real to show for it as result you enjoyed the game and the victory no doubt at the time but you have no result that you can treasure up and get real good out of </s>
<s> and all the while you have been leaving unexplored perfect mine of wealth </s>
<s> once master the machinery of symbolic logic and you have mental occupation always at hand of absorbing interest and one that will be of real use to you in any subject you may take up </s>
<s> it will give you clearness of thought the ability to see your way through puzzle the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get at able form and more valuable than all the power to detect fallacies and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments which you will so continually encounter in books in newspapers in speeches and even in sermons and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating art </s>

<s> thus the thing rose may have the attributes red scented full blown and the attribute red may belong to the things rose brick ribbon any attribute or any set of attributes may be called an adjunct this word is introduced in order to avoid the constant repetition of the phrase attribute or set of attributes thus we may say that rose has the attribute red or the adjunct red whichever we prefer or we may say that it has the adjunct red scented and full blown pg chapter ii </s>
<s> classification classification or the formation of classes is mental process in which we imagine that we have put together in group certain things </s>
<s> such group is called class this process may be performed in three different ways as follows we may imagine that we have put together all things </s>
<s> the class so formed </s>
<s> the class things contains the whole universe </s>
<s> we may think of the class things and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the things which possess certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class </s>
<s> this adjunct is said to be peculiar to the class so formed </s>
<s> in this case the class things is called genus with regard to the class so formed the class so formed is called species of the class things and its peculiar adjunct is called its differentia </s>
<s> pg as this process is entirely mental we can perform it whether there is or is not an existing thing which possesses that adjunct </s>
<s> if there is the class is said to be real if not it is said to be unreal or imaginary for example we may imagine that we have picked out from the class things all the things which possess the adjunct material artificial consisting of houses and streets and we may thus form the real class towns here we may regard things as genus towns as species of things and material artificial consisting of houses and streets as its differentia </s>
<s> again we may imagine that we have picked out all the things which possess the adjunct weighing ton easily lifted by baby and we may thus form the imaginary class things that weigh ton and are easily lifted by baby we may think of certain class not the class things and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the members of it which possess certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class </s>
<s> this adjunct is said to be peculiar to the smaller class so formed </s>
<s> in this case the class thought of is called genus with regard to the smaller class picked out from it the smaller class is called species of the larger and its peculiar adjunct is called its differentia </s>
<s> for example we may think of the class towns and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the attribute lit with gas and we may thus form the real class towns lit with gas here we may regard towns as genus towns lit with gas as species of towns and lit with gas as its differentia </s>
<s> if in the above example we were to alter lit with gas into paved with gold we should get the imaginary class towns paved with gold class containing only one member is called an individual for example the class towns having four million inhabitants which class contains only one member viz </s>
<s> london pg hence any single thing which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other things may be regarded as one member class </s>
<s> thus london may be regarded as the one member class picked out from the class towns which has as its differentia having four million inhabitants class containing two or more members is sometimes regarded as one single thing </s>
<s> when so regarded it may possess an adjunct which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately </s>
<s> thus the class the soldiers of the tenth regiment when regarded as one single thing may possess the attribute formed in square which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately pg chapter iii </s>
<s> division </s>
<s> introductory division is mental process in which we think of certain class of things and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller classes </s>
<s> thus we might think of the class books and imagine that we had divided it into the two smaller classes bound books and unbound books or into the three classes books priced at less than shilling shilling books books priced at more than shilling or into the twenty six classes books whose names begin with books whose names begin with class that has been obtained by certain division is said to be codivisional with every class obtained by that division </s>
<s> thus the class bound books is codivisional with each of the two classes bound books and unbound books similarly the battle of waterloo may be said to have been contemporary with every event that happened in hence class obtained by division is codivisional with itself </s>
<s> thus the class bound books is codivisional with itself </s>
<s> similarly the battle of waterloo may be said to have been contemporary with itself pg </s>
<s> dichotomy if we think of certain class and imagine that we have picked out from it certain smaller class it is evident that the remainder of the large class does not possess the differentia of that smaller class </s>
<s> hence it may be regarded as another smaller class whose differentia may be formed from that of the class first picked out by prefixing the word not and we may imagine that we have divided the class first thought of into two smaller classes whose differenti are contradictory </s>
<s> this kind of division is called dichotomy </s>
<s> for example we may divide books into the two classes whose differenti are old and not old in performing this process we may sometimes find that the attributes we have chosen are used so loosely in ordinary conversation that it is not easy to decide which of the things belong to the one class and which to the other </s>

<s> pg appendix addressed to teachers </s>
<s> </s>
<s> introductory there are several matters too hard to discuss with learners which nevertheless need to be explained to any teachers into whose hands this book may fall in order that they may thoroughly understand what my symbolic method is and in what respects it differs from the many other methods already published </s>
<s> these matters are as follows the existential import of propositions </s>
<s> the use of is not or are not as copula </s>
<s> the theory two negative premisses prove nothing euler's method of diagrams </s>
<s> venn's method of diagrams </s>
<s> my method of diagrams </s>
<s> the solution of syllogism by various methods </s>
<s> my method of treating syllogisms and sorites </s>
<s> some account of parts ii iii </s>
<s> </s>
<s> the existential import of propositions the writers and editors of the logical text books which run in the ordinary grooves to whom shall hereafter refer by the hope inoffensive title the logicians take on this subject what seems to me to be more humble position than is at all necessary </s>
<s> they speak of the copula of proposition with bated breath almost as if it were living conscious entity capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean and that we poor human creatures had nothing to do but to ascertain what was its sovereign will and pleasure and submit to it </s>
<s> pg in opposition to this view maintain that any writer of book is fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use </s>
<s> if find an author saying at the beginning of his book let it be understood that by the word black shall always mean white and that by the word white shall always mean black meekly accept his ruling however injudicious may think it </s>
<s> and so with regard to the question whether proposition is or is not to be understood as asserting the existence of its subject maintain that every writer may adopt his own rule provided of course that it is consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of logic </s>
<s> let us consider certain views that may logically be held and thus settle which of them may conveniently be held after which shall hold myself free to declare which of them intend to hold </s>
<s> the kinds of propositions to be considered are those that begin with some with no and with all </s>
<s> these are usually called propositions in in and in </s>
<s> first then proposition in may be understood as asserting or else as not asserting the existence of its subject </s>
<s> by existence mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature </s>
<s> the two propositions dreams exist and drums exist denote two totally different kinds of existence </s>
<s> dream is an aggregate of ideas and exists only in the mind of dreamer whereas drum is an aggregate of wood and parchment and exists in the hands of drummer first let us suppose that asserts </s>
<s> asserts the existence of its subject </s>
<s> here of course we must regard proposition in as making the same assertion since it necessarily contains proposition in </s>
<s> we now have and asserting </s>
<s> does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to </s>
<s> my answer is no </s>
<s> we are tied down to the supposition that does not assert this can be proved as follows if possible let assert </s>
<s> then taking and to represent attributes we see that if the proposition no xy are be true some things exist with the attributes and </s>
<s> some are pg also we know that if the proposition some xy are be true the same result follows </s>
<s> but these two propositions are contradictories so that one or other of them must be true </s>
<s> hence this result is always true </s>
<s> the proposition some are is always true </s>
<s> quod est absurdum see note </s>
<s> </s>
<s> we see then that the supposition asserts necessarily leads to asserts but does not </s>
<s> and this is the first of the various views that may conceivably be held </s>
<s> next let us suppose that does not assert and along with this let us take the supposition that does assert hence the proposition no are means some exist and none of them are </s>
<s> all of them are not which is proposition in </s>
<s> we also know of course that the proposition all are not proves no are now two propositions each of which proves the other are equivalent </s>
<s> hence every proposition in is equivalent to one in and therefore asserts </s>
<s> hence our second conceivable view is and assert but does not this view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of logic </s>
<s> but when we come to test it as applied to the actual facts of life we shall find think that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be to say the least of it singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk </s>
<s> let me record little dialogue have just held with my friend jones who is trying to form new club to be regulated on strictly logical principles </s>
<s> author well jones </s>
<s> have you got your new club started yet jones rubbing his hands </s>
<s> you'll be glad to hear that some of the members mind only say some are millionaires </s>
<s> rolling in gold my boy author that sounds well </s>
<s> and how many members have entered jones staring </s>
<s> none at all </s>
<s> we haven't got it started yet </s>
<s> what makes you think we have author why thought you said that some of the members pg jones contemptuously </s>
<s> you don't seem to be aware that we're working on strictly logical principles </s>
<s> particular proposition does not assert the existence of its subject </s>
<s> merely meant to say that we've made rule not to admit any members till we have at least three candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand year author oh that's what you meant is it </s>
<s> let's hear some more of your rules jones another is that no one who has been convicted seven times of forgery is admissible author and here again suppose you don't mean to assert there are any such convicts in existence jones why that's exactly what do mean to assert </s>
<s> don't you know that universal negative asserts the existence of its subject </s>
<s> of course we didn't make that rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living the reader can now decide for himself how far this second conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life </s>
<s> he will think agree with me that jones view of the existential import of propositions would lead to some inconvenience </s>
<s> thirdly let us suppose that neither nor asserts </s>
<s> now the supposition that the two propositions some are and no are not do not assert necessarily involves the supposition that all are does not assert since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert when combined more than they do when taken separately </s>
<s> hence the third and last of the conceivable views is that neither nor nor asserts </s>
<s> the advocates of this third view would interpret the proposition some are to mean if there were any in existence some of them would be and so with and </s>
<s> it admits of proof that this view as regards conflicts with the accepted facts of logic </s>
<s> let us take the syllogism darapti which is universally accepted as valid </s>
<s> its form is all are all are </s>
<s> </s>
<s> some are </s>
<s> pg this they would interpret as follows if there were any in existence all of them would be if there were any in existence all of them would be </s>
<s> </s>
<s> if there were any in existence some of them would be </s>
<s> that this conclusion does not follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by mr keynes in his formal logic dated pp </s>
<s> that prefer to quote his words let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its predicate take as an example syllogism in darapti all is all is </s>
<s> some is taking as the minor middle and major terms respectively the conclusion will imply that if there is an there is some </s>
<s> will the premisses also imply this </s>
<s> if so then the syllogism is valid but not otherwise </s>
<s> the conclusion implies that if exists exists but consistently with the premisses may be existent while and are both non existent </s>
<s> an implication is therefore contained in the conclusion which is not justified by the premisses this seems to me entirely clear and convincing </s>
<s> still to make sicker may as well throw the above soi disant syllogism into concrete form which will be within the grasp of even non logical reader </s>
<s> let us suppose that boys school has been set up with the following system of rules all boys in the first the highest class are to do french greek and latin </s>
<s> all in the second class are to do greek only </s>
<s> all in the third class are to do latin only suppose also that there are boys in the third class and in the second but that no boy has yet risen into the first </s>
<s> it is evident that there are no boys in the school doing french still we know by the rules what would happen if there were any </s>
<s> pg we are authorised then by the data to assert the following two propositions if there were any boys doing french all of them would be doing greek if there were any boys doing french all of them would be doing latin and the conclusion according to the logicians would be if there were any boys doing latin some of them would be doing greek here then we have two true premisses and false conclusion since we know that there are boys doing latin and that none of them are doing greek </s>
<s> hence the argument is invalid </s>
<s> similarly it may be shown that this non existential interpretation destroys the validity of disamis datisi felapton and fresison </s>
<s> some of the logicians will no doubt be ready to reply but we are not aldrichians </s>
<s> why should we be responsible for the validity of the syllogisms of so antiquated an author as aldrich very good </s>
<s> then for the special benefit of these friends of mine with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used </s>
<s> must have private interview with you my young friend says the bland dr </s>
<s> birch in my library at </s>
<s> tomorrow </s>
<s> and you will please to be punctual for their special benefit say will produce another charge against this non existential interpretation </s>
<s> it actually invalidates the ordinary process of conversion as applied to proposition in </s>
<s> every logician aldrichian or otherwise accepts it as an established fact that some are may be legitimately converted into some are but is it equally clear that the proposition if there were any some of them would be may be legitimately converted into if there were any some of them would be </s>
<s> trow not </s>
<s> the example have already used of boys school with non existent first class will serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the theory of the logicians pg let us suppose that there is yet another rule in this school viz </s>
<s> in each class at the end of the term the head boy and the second boy shall receive prizes this rule entirely authorises us to assert in the sense in which the logicians would use the words some boys in the first class will receive prizes for this simply means according to them if there were any boys in the first class some of them would receive prizes now the converse of this proposition is of course some boys who will receive prizes are in the first class which means according to the logicians if there were any boys about to receive prizes some of them would be in the first class which class we know to be empty </s>
<s> of this pair of converse propositions the first is undoubtedly true the second as undoubtedly false </s>
<s> it is always sad to see batsman knock down his own wicket one pities him as man and brother but as cricketer one can but pronounce him out we see then that among all the conceivable views we have here considered there are only two which can logically be held viz </s>
<s> and assert but does not </s>
<s> and assert but does not </s>
<s> the second of these have shown to involve great practical inconvenience </s>

<s> </s>
<s> the use of is not or are not as copula is it better to say john is not in the house or john is not in the house </s>
<s> some of my acquaintances are not men should like to be seen with or some of my acquaintances are men should not like to be seen with </s>
<s> that is the sort of question we have now to discuss </s>
<s> pg this is no question of logical right and wrong it is merely matter of taste since the two forms mean exactly the same thing </s>
<s> and here again the logicians seem to me to take much too humble position </s>
<s> when they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their proposition just before the curtain goes up and when the copula always rather fussy heavy father asks them am to have the not or will you tack it on to the predicate they are much too ready to answer like the subtle cab driver leave it to you sir the result seems to be that the grasping copula constantly gets not that had better have been merged in the predicate and that propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as precisely similar </s>
<s> surely it is simpler to treat some men are jews and some men are gentiles as being both of them affirmative propositions instead of translating the latter into some men are not jews and regarding it as negative propositions </s>
<s> the fact is the logicians have somehow acquired perfectly morbid dread of negative attributes which makes them shut their eyes like frightened children when they come across such terrible propositions as all not are and thus they exclude from their system many very useful forms of syllogisms </s>
<s> under the influence of this unreasoning terror they plead that in dichotomy by contradiction the negative part is too large to deal with so that it is better to regard each thing as either included in or excluded from the positive part </s>
<s> see no force in this plea and the facts often go the other way </s>
<s> as personal question dear reader if you were to group your acquaintances into the two classes men that you would like to be seen with and men that you would not like to be seen with do you think the latter group would be so very much the larger of the two </s>
<s> for the purposes of symbolic logic it is so much the most convenient plan to regard the two sub divisions produced by dichotomy on the same footing and to say of any thing either that it is in the one or that it is in the other that do not think any reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course </s>
<s> pg </s>
<s> the theory that two negative premisses prove nothing this consider to be another craze of the logicians fully as morbid as their dread of negative attribute </s>
<s> it is perhaps best refuted by the method of instantia contraria </s>
<s> take the following pairs of premisses none of my boys are conceited none of my girls are greedy </s>
<s> none of my boys are clever none but clever boy could solve this problem </s>
<s> none of my boys are learned some of my boys are not choristers </s>
<s> this last proposition is in my system an affirmative one since should read it are not choristers but in dealing with the logicians may fairly treat it as negative one since they would read it are not choristers if you dear reader declare after full consideration of these pairs of premisses that you cannot deduce conclusion from any of them why all can say is that like the duke in patience you will have to be contented with our heart felt sympathy </s>

<s> euler's method of diagrams diagrams seem to have been used at first to represent propositions only </s>
<s> in euler's well known circles each was supposed to contain class and the diagram consisted of two circles which exhibited the relations as to inclusion and exclusion existing between the two classes </s>
<s> thus the diagram here given exhibits the two classes whose respective attributes are and as so related to each other that the following propositions are all simultaneously true all are no are not some are some are not some not are not and of course the converses of the last four </s>
<s> pg similarly with this diagram the following propositions are true all are no are not some are some are not some not are not and of course the converses of the last four </s>
<s> similarly with this diagram the following are true all are not all are not no are some are not some are not some not are not and the converses of the last four </s>
<s> similarly with this diagram the following are true some are some are not some not are some not are not and of course their four converses </s>
<s> note that all euler's diagrams assert some not are not apparently it never occured to him that it might sometimes fail to be true </s>
<s> now to represent all are the first of these diagrams would suffice </s>
<s> similarly to represent no are the third would suffice </s>
<s> but to represent any particular proposition at least three diagrams would be needed in order to include all the possible cases and for some not are not all the four </s>
<s> </s>
<s> venn's method of diagrams let us represent not by </s>
<s> mr venn's method of diagrams is great advance on the above method </s>
<s> he uses the last of the above diagrams to represent any desired relation between and by simply shading compartment known to be empty and placing in one known to be occupied </s>
<s> thus he would represent the three propositions some are no are and all are as follows pg it will be seen that of the four classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are xy xy x'y and x'y only three are here provided with closed compartments while the fourth is allowed the rest of the infinite plane to range about in </s>
<s> this arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble if we ever attempted to represent no are mr venn once at </s>
<s> encounters this awful task but evades it in quite masterly fashion by the simple foot note we have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram </s>
<s> to represent two propositions containing common term together three letter diagram is needed </s>
<s> this is the one used by mr venn </s>
<s> here again we have only seven closed compartments to accommodate the eight classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are xym xym </s>
<s> with four terms in request mr venn says the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner </s>
<s> this however provides only fifteen closed compartments </s>
<s> for five letters the simplest diagram can suggest mr venn says is one like this the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as portion of the outside of </s>
<s> its four component portions are inside and but are no part of </s>
<s> it must be admitted that such diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be but then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with five terms and all their combinations nothing short of the disagreeable task of writing out or in some way putting before us all the combinations involved pg this diagram gives us closed compartments </s>
<s> for six letters mr venn suggests that we might use two diagrams like the above one for the part and the other for the not part of all the other combinations </s>
<s> this he says would give the desired subdivisions this however would only give closed compartments and one infinite area which the two classes a'b c'd e'f and a'b c'd e'f would have to share between them </s>
<s> beyond six letters mr venn does not go </s>
<s> </s>
<s> my method of diagrams my method of diagrams resembles mr venn's in having separate compartments assigned to the various classes and in marking these compartments as occupied or as empty but it differs from his method in assigning closed area to the universe of discourse so that the class which under mr venn's liberal sway has been ranging at will through infinite space is suddenly dismayed to find itself cabin'd cribb'd confined in limited cell like any other class </s>
<s> also use rectilinear instead of curvilinear figures and mark an occupied cell with meaning that there is at least one thing in it and an empty cell with meaning that there is no thing in it </s>
<s> for two letters use this diagram in which the north half is assigned to the south to not or the west to and the east to </s>
<s> thus the </s>

<s> for three letters subdivide these four cells by drawing an inner square which assign to the outer border being assigned to </s>
<s> thus get eight cells that are needed to accommodate the eight classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are xym xym </s>
<s> this last diagram is the most complex that use in the elementary part of my symbolic logic but may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which will appear in part ii </s>
<s> pg for four letters which call use this diagram assigning the north half to and of course the rest of the diagram to the west half to the horizontal oblong to and the upright oblong to </s>
<s> we have now got cells </s>
<s> for five letters adding subdivide the cells of the previous diagram by oblique partitions assigning all the upper portions to and all the lower portions to </s>
<s> here admit we lose the advantage of having the class all together in ring fence like the other classes </s>
<s> still it is very easy to find and the operation of erasing it is nearly as easy as that of erasing any other class </s>
<s> we have now got cells </s>
<s> for six letters adding as avoid tailed letters substitute upright crosses for the oblique partitions assigning the portions into which each of the cells is thus divided to the four classes eh eh e'h e'h </s>
<s> we have now got cells </s>
<s> pg for seven letters adding add to each upright cross little inner square </s>
<s> all these little squares are assigned to the class and all outside them to the class so that little cells into which each of the cells is divided are respectively assigned to the classes ehk ehk </s>
<s> we have now got cells </s>
<s> for eight letters adding place in each of the cells lattice which is reduced copy of the whole diagram and just as the large cells of the whole diagram are assigned to the classes abcd abcd so the little cells of each lattice are assigned to the classes ehkl ehkl </s>

<s> propositions </s>
<s> some new cakes are nice no new cakes are nice all new cakes are nice there are three propositions for you the only three kinds we are going to use in this game and the first thing to be done is to learn how to express them on the board </s>
<s> let us begin with some new cakes are nice but before doing so remark has to be made one that is rather important and by no means easy to understand all in moment so please to read this very carefully </s>
<s> the world contains many things such as buns babies beetles </s>
<s> battledores </s>
<s> and these things possess many attributes such as baked beautiful black broken in fact whatever can be attributed to that is said to belong to any thing is an attribute </s>
<s> whenever we wish to mention thing we use substantive when we wish to mention an attribute we use an adjective </s>
<s> people have asked the question can thing exist without any attributes belonging to it it is very puzzling question and i'm not going to try to answer it let us turn up our noses and treat it with contemptuous silence as if it really wasn't worth noticing </s>
<s> but if they put it the other way and ask can an attribute exist without any thing for it to belong to we may say at once no no more than baby could go railway journey with no one to take care of it you never saw beautiful floating about in the air or littered about on the floor without any thing to be beautiful now did you </s>
<s> and now what am driving at in all this long rigmarole </s>
<s> it is this </s>
<s> you may put is or are between names of two things for example some pigs are fat animals or between the names of two attributes for example pink is light red and in each case it will make good sense </s>
<s> but if you put is or are between the name of thing and the name of an attribute for example some pigs are pink you do not make good sense for how can thing be an attribute unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking </s>
<s> and the simplest understanding would think be this that the substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence so that the sentence if written out in full would be some pigs are pink pigs </s>
<s> and now the word are makes quite good sense </s>
<s> thus in order to make good sense of the proposition some new cakes are nice we must suppose it to be written out in full in the form some new cakes are nice cakes </s>
<s> now this contains two terms new cakes being one of them and nice cakes the other </s>
<s> new cakes being the one we are talking about is called the subject of the proposition and nice cakes the predicate </s>
<s> also this proposition is said to be particular one since it does not speak of the whole of its subject but only of part of it </s>
<s> the other two kinds are said to be universal because they speak of the whole of their subjects the one denying niceness and the other asserting it of the whole class of new cakes </s>
<s> lastly if you would like to have definition of the word proposition itself you may take this sentence stating that some or none or all of the things belonging to certain class called its subject are also things belonging to certain other class called its predicate </s>
<s> you will find these seven words proposition attribute term subject predicate particular universal charmingly useful if any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied logic </s>
<s> mind you bring all seven words into your answer and you friend will go away deeply impressed sadder and wiser man </s>
<s> now please to look at the smaller diagram on the board and suppose it to be cupboard intended for all the cakes in the world it would have to be good large one of course </s>
<s> and let us suppose all the new ones to be put into the upper half marked and all the rest that is the not new ones into the lower half marked </s>
<s> thus the lower half would contain elderly cakes aged cakes ante diluvian cakes if there are any haven't seen many myself and so on </s>
<s> let us also suppose all the nice cakes to be put into the left hand half marked and all the rest that is the not nice ones into the right hand half marked </s>
<s> at present then we must understand to mean new not new nice and not nice and now what kind of cakes would you expect to find in compartment no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> it is part of the upper half you see so that if it has any cakes in it they must be new and it is part of the left hand half so that they must be nice </s>
<s> hence if there are any cakes in this compartment they must have the double attribute new and nice or if we use letters the must be observe that the letters are written on two of the edges of this compartment </s>
<s> this you will find very convenient rule for knowing what attributes belong to the things in any compartment </s>
<s> take no </s>
<s> for instance </s>
<s> if there are any cakes there they must be that is they must be not new and nice now let us make another agreement that red counter in compartment shall mean that it is occupied that is that there are some cakes in it </s>
<s> the word some in logic means one or more so that single cake in compartment would be quite enough reason for saying there are some cakes here </s>
<s> also let us agree that grey counter in compartment shall mean that it is empty that is that there are no cakes in it </s>
<s> in the following diagrams shall put meaning one or more where you are to put red counter and meaning none where you are to put grey one </s>
<s> as the subject of our proposition is to be new cakes we are only concerned at present with the upper half of the cupboard where all the cakes have the attribute that is new now fixing our attention on this upper half suppose we found it marked like this that is with red counter in no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> what would this tell us with regard to the class of new cakes </s>
<s> would it not tell us that there are some of them in the compartment </s>
<s> that is that some of them besides having the attribute which belongs to both compartments have the attribute that is nice </s>
<s> this we might express by saying some cakes are cakes or putting words instead of letters some new cakes are nice cakes or in shorter form some new cakes are nice </s>
<s> at last we have found out how to represent the first proposition of this section </s>
<s> if you have not clearly understood all have said go no further but read it over and over again till you do understand it </s>
<s> after that is once mastered you will find all the rest quite easy </s>
<s> it will save little trouble in doing the other propositions if we agree to leave out the word cakes altogether </s>
<s> find it convenient to call the whole class of things for which the cupboard is intended the universe thus we might have begun this business by saying let us take universe of cakes sounds nice doesn't it of course any other things would have done just as well as cakes </s>
<s> we might make propositions about universe of lizards or even universe of hornets </s>
<s> wouldn't that be charming universe to live in so far then we have learned that means some and </s>
<s> some new are nice think you will see without further explanation that means some are </s>
<s> some new are not nice now let us put grey counter into no </s>
<s> and ask ourselves the meaning of this tells us that the compartment is empty which we may express by no are or no new cakes are nice </s>
<s> this is the second of the three propositions at the head of this section </s>
<s> in the same way would mean no are or no new cakes are not nice what would you make of this wonder </s>
<s> hope you will not have much trouble in making out that this represents double proposition namely some are and some are </s>
<s> some new are nice and some are not nice the following is little harder perhaps this means no are and none are </s>
<s> no new are nice and none are not nice which leads to the rather curious result that no new exist </s>
<s> no cakes are new this is because nice and not nice make what we call an exhaustive division of the class new cakes </s>
<s> between them they exhaust the whole class so that all the new cakes that exist must be found in one or the other of them </s>
<s> and now suppose you had to represent with counters the contradictory to no cakes are new which would be some cakes are new or putting letters for words some cakes are how would you do it </s>
<s> this will puzzle you little expect </s>
<s> evidently you must put red counter somewhere in the half of the cupboard since you know there are some new cakes </s>
<s> but you must not put it into the left hand compartment since you do not know them to be nice nor may you put it into the right hand one since you do not know them to be not nice </s>
<s> what then are you to do </s>
<s> think the best way out of the difficulty is to place the red counter on the division line between the xy compartment and the xy compartment </s>
<s> this shall represent as always put where you are to put red counter by the diagram our ingenious american cousins have invented phrase to express the position of man who wants to join one or the other of two parties such as their two parties democrats and republicans but can't make up his mind which </s>
<s> such man is said to be sitting on the fence now that is exactly the position of the red counter you have just placed on the division line </s>
<s> he likes the look of no </s>
<s> and he likes the look of no </s>
<s> and he doesn't know which to jump down into </s>
<s> so there he sits astride silly fellow dangling his legs one on each side of the fence </s>
<s> now am going to give you much harder one to make out </s>
<s> what does this mean </s>
<s> this is clearly double proposition </s>
<s> it tells us not only that some are but also the no are not hence the result is all are </s>
<s> all new cakes are nice which is the last of the three propositions at the head of this section </s>
<s> we see then that the universal proposition all new cakes are nice consists of two propositions taken together namely some new cakes are nice and no new cakes are not nice in the same way would mean all are that is all new cakes are not nice now what would you make of such proposition as the cake you have given me is nice </s>
<s> is it particular or universal </s>
<s> particular of course you readily reply </s>
<s> one single cake is hardly worth calling some even no my dear impulsive reader it is universal </s>
<s> remember that few as they are and grant you they couldn't well be fewer they are or rather it is all that you have given me </s>
<s> thus if leaving red out of the question divide my universe of cakes into two classes the cakes you have given me to which assign the upper half of the cupboard and those you haven't given me which are to go below find the lower half fairly full and the upper one as nearly as possible empty </s>
<s> and then when am told to put an upright division into each half keeping the nice cakes to the left and the not nice ones to the right begin by carefully collecting all the cakes you have given me saying to myself from time to time generous creature </s>
<s> how shall ever repay such kindness and piling them up in the left hand compartment </s>
<s> and it doesn't take long to do it </s>
<s> here is another universal proposition for you </s>
<s> barzillai beckalegg is an honest man that means all the barzillai beckaleggs that am now considering are honest men you think invented that name now don't you </s>
<s> but didn't </s>
<s> it's on carrier's cart somewhere down in cornwall this kind of universal proposition where the subject is single thing is called an individual proposition </s>
<s> now let us take nice cakes as the subject of proposition that is let us fix our thoughts on the left hand half of the cupboard where all the cakes have attribute that is nice suppose we find it marked like this what would that tell us </s>
<s> hope that it is not necessary after explaining the horizontal oblong so fully to spend much time over the upright one </s>
<s> hope you will see for yourself that this means some are that is some nice cakes are new but you will say we have had this case before </s>
<s> you put red counter into no </s>
<s> and you told us it meant some new cakes are nice and now you tell us that it means some nice cakes are new </s>
<s> can it mean both the question is very thoughtful one and does you great credit dear reader </s>
<s> it does mean both </s>
<s> if you choose to take that is new cakes as your subject and to regard no </s>
<s> as part of horizontal oblong you may read it some are that is some new cakes are nice but if you choose to take that is nice cake as your subject and to regard no </s>
<s> as part of an upright oblong then you may read it some are that is some nice cakes are new </s>
<s> they are merely two different ways of expressing the very same truth </s>
<s> without more words will simply set down the other ways in which this upright oblong might be marked adding the meaning in each case </s>
<s> by comparing them with the various cases of the horizontal oblong you will hope be able to understand them clearly </s>
<s> you will find it good plan to examine yourself on this table by covering up first one column and then the other and dodging about as the children say </s>
<s> also you will do well to write out for yourself two other tables one for the lower half of the cupboard and the other for its right hand half </s>
<s> and now think we have said all we need to say about the smaller diagram and may go on to the larger one </s>
<s> symbols </s>
<s> meanings </s>
<s> some are </s>
<s> some nice are not new </s>
<s> no are </s>
<s> no nice are new </s>
<s> observe that this is merely another way of expressing no new are nice no are </s>
<s> no nice are not new </s>
<s> some are and some are </s>
<s> some nice are new and some are not new </s>
<s> no are and none are </s>
<s> no exist </s>
<s> no cakes are nice </s>
<s> all are </s>
<s> all nice are new </s>
<s> all are </s>
<s> all nice are not new </s>
<s> this may be taken to be cupboard divided in the same way as the last but also divided into two portions for the attribute </s>
<s> let us give to the meaning wholesome and let us suppose that all wholesome cakes are placed inside the central square and all the unwholesome ones outside it that is in one or other of the four queer shaped outer compartments </s>
<s> we see that just as in the smaller diagram the cakes in each compartment had two attributes so here the cakes in each compartment have three attributes and just as the letters representing the two attributes were written on the edges of the compartment so here they are written at the corners </s>
<s> observe that is supposed to be written at each of the four outer corners so that we can tell in moment by looking at compartment what three attributes belong to the things in it </s>
<s> for instance take no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> here we find at the corners so we know that the cakes in it if there are any have the triple attribute xy'm that is new not nice and wholesome again take no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> here we find at the corners so the cakes in it are not new not nice and unwholesome remarkably untempting cakes it would take far too long to go through all the propositions containing and and and and which can be represented on this diagram there are ninety six altogether so am sure you will excuse me and must content myself with doing two or three as specimens </s>
<s> you will do well to work out lot more for yourself </s>
<s> taking the upper half by itself so that our subject is new cakes how are we to represent no new cakes are wholesome </s>
<s> this is writing letters for words no are now this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the upper half of the cupboard are to be found inside the central square that is the two compartments no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> are empty </s>
<s> and this of course is represented by and now how are we to represent the contradictory proposition some are </s>
<s> this is difficulty have already considered </s>
<s> think the best way is to place red counter on the division line between no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> and to understand this to mean that one of the two compartments is occupied but that we do not at present know which </s>
<s> this shall represent thus now let us express all are this consists we know of two propositions some are and no are let us express the negative part first </s>
<s> this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the upper half of the cupboard are to be found outside the central square that is the two compartments no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> are empty </s>
<s> this of course is represented by but we have yet to represent some are this tells us that there are some cakes in the oblong consisting of no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> so we place our red counter as in the previous example on the division line between no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> and the result is now let us try one or two interpretations </s>
<s> what are we to make of this with regard to and </s>
<s> this tells us with regard to the xy square that it is wholly empty since both compartments are so marked </s>
<s> with regard to the xy square it tells us that it is occupied </s>
<s> true it is only one compartment of it that is so marked but that is quite enough whether the other be occupied or empty to settle the fact that there is something in the square </s>
<s> if then we transfer our marks to the smaller diagram so as to get rid of the subdivisions we have right to mark it which means you know all are the result would have been exactly the same if the given oblong had been marked thus once more how shall we interpret this with regard to and </s>
<s> this tells us as to the xy square that one of its compartments is empty </s>
<s> but this information is quite useless as there is no mark in the other compartment </s>
<s> if the other compartment happened to be empty too the square would be empty and if it happened to be occupied the square would be occupied </s>
<s> so as we do not know which is the case we can say nothing about this square </s>
<s> the other square the xy square we know as in the previous example to be occupied </s>
<s> if then we transfer our marks to the smaller diagram we get merely this which means you know some are these principles may be applied to all the other oblongs </s>
<s> for instance to represent all are we should mark the right hand upright oblong the one that has the attribute thus and if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard marked as follows with regard to and we should transfer it to the smaller diagram thus and read it all are two more remarks about propositions need to be made </s>
<s> one is that in every proposition beginning with some or all the actual existence of the subject is asserted </s>
<s> if for instance say all misers are selfish mean that misers actually exist </s>
<s> if wished to avoid making this assertion and merely to state the law that miserliness necessarily involves selfishness should say no misers are unselfish which does not assert that any misers exist at all but merely that if any did exist they would be selfish </s>
<s> the other is that when proposition begins with some or no and contains more that two attributes these attributes may be re arranged and shifted from one term to the other ad libitum for example some abc are def may be re arranged as some bf are acde each being equivalent to some things are abcdef </s>
<s> again no wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers may be re arranged as no rash old gamblers are wise and reckless each being equivalent to no men are wise old rash reckless gamblers </s>
<s> syllogisms now suppose we divide our universe of things in three ways with regard to three different attributes </s>
<s> out of these three attributes we may make up three different couples for instance if they were we might make up the three couples ab ac bc </s>
<s> also suppose we have two propositions given us containing two of these three couples and that from them we can prove third proposition containing the third couple </s>
<s> for example if we divide our universe for and and if we have the two propositions given us no are and all are containing the two couples mx and my it might be possible to prove from them third proposition containing and in such case we call the given propositions the premisses the third one the conclusion and the whole set syllogism </s>
<s> evidently one of the attributes must occur in both premisses or else one must occur in one premiss and its contradictory in the other </s>
<s> in the first case when for example the premisses are some are and no are the term which occurs twice is called the middle term because it serves as sort of link between the other two terms </s>
<s> in the second case when for example the premisses are no are and all are the two terms which contain these contradictory attributes may be called the middle terms </s>
<s> thus in the first case the class of things is the middle term and in the second case the two classes of things and things are the middle terms </s>
<s> the attribute which occurs in the middle term or terms disappears in the conclusion and is said to be eliminated which literally means turned out of doors </s>
<s> now let us try to draw conclusion from the two premisses some new cakes are unwholesome no nice cakes are unwholesome in order to express them with counters we need to divide cakes in three different ways with regard to newness to niceness and to wholesomeness </s>
<s> for this we must use the larger diagram making mean new nice and wholesome </s>
<s> everything inside the central square is supposed to have the attribute and everything outside it the attribute </s>
<s> not you had better adopt the rule to make mean the attribute which occurs in the middle term or terms </s>
<s> have chosen as the symbol because middle begins with now in representing the two premisses prefer to begin with the negative one the one beginning with no because grey counters can always be placed with certainty and will then help to fix the position of the red counters which are sometimes little uncertain where they will be most welcome </s>
<s> let us express the no nice cakes are unwholesome cakes </s>
<s> no cakes are cakes </s>
<s> this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the half of the cupboard are in its compartments </s>
<s> the ones outside the central square </s>
<s> hence the two compartments no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> are both empty and we must place grey counter in each of them thus we have now to express the other premiss namely some new cakes are unwholesome cakes </s>
<s> some cakes are cakes </s>
<s> this tells us that some of the cakes in the half of the cupboard are in its compartments </s>
<s> hence one of the two compartments no </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> is occupied and as we are not told in which of these two compartments to place the red counter the usual rule would be to lay it on the division line between them but in this case the other premiss has settled the matter for us by declaring no </s>
<s> to be empty </s>
<s> hence the red counter has no choice and must go into no </s>
<s> thus and now what counters will this information enable us to place in the smaller diagram so as to get some proposition involving and only leaving out </s>
<s> let us take its four compartments one by one </s>
<s> first no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> all we know about this is that its outer portion is empty but we know nothing about its inner portion </s>
<s> thus the square may be empty or it may have something in it </s>
<s> who can tell </s>
<s> so we dare not place any counter in this square </s>
<s> secondly what of no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> here we are little better off </s>
<s> we know that there is something in it for there is red counter in its outer portion </s>
<s> it is true we do not know whether its inner portion is empty or occupied but what does that matter </s>

<s> we find it partly empty but we do not know whether the other part is empty or occupied so we dare not mark this square </s>
<s> and as to no </s>
<s> we have simply no information at all </s>
<s> the result is our conclusion then must be got out of the rather meager piece of information that there is red counter in the xy square </s>
<s> hence our conclusion is some are </s>
<s> some new cakes are not nice cakes or if you prefer to take as your subject some not nice cakes are new cakes but the other looks neatest </s>
<s> we will now write out the whole syllogism putting the symbol there for therefore and omitting cakes for the sake of brevity at the end of each proposition </s>

<s> there is no font available in general practice which renders the therefore symbol correction three dots in triangular formation </s>
<s> this can be done however in html so if this document is read in browser then the symbol will be properly recognized </s>
<s> this is poor man's excuse some new cakes are unwholesome no nice cakes are unwholesome there some new cakes are not nice and you have now worked out successfully your first syllogism </s>
<s> permit me to congratulate you and to express the hope that it is but the beginning of long and glorious series of similar victories </s>
<s> we will work out one other syllogism rather harder one than the last and then think you may be safely left to play the game by yourself or better with any friend whom you can find that is able and willing to take share in the sport </s>
<s> let us see what we can make of the two premisses all dragons are uncanny all scotchmen are canny remember don't guarantee the premisses to be facts </s>
<s> in the first place never even saw dragon and in the second place it isn't of the slightest consequence to us as logicians whether our premisses are true or false all we have to do is to make out whether they lead logically to the conclusion so that if they were true it would be true also </s>
<s> you see we must give up the cakes now or our cupboard will be of no use to us </s>
<s> we must take as our universe some class of things which will include dragons and scotchmen shall we say animals </s>
<s> and as canny is evidently the attribute belonging to the middle terms we will let stand for canny for dragons and for scotchmen </s>
<s> so that our two premisses are in full all dragon animals are uncanny animals all scotchman animals are canny animals and these may be expressed using letters for words thus all are all are the first premiss consists as you already know of two parts some are and no are and the second also consists of two parts some are and no are let us take the negative portions first </s>
<s> we have then to mark on the larger diagram first no are and secondly no are </s>
<s> think you will see without further explanation that the two results separately are and that these two when combined give us we have now to mark the two positive portions some are and some are </s>

<s> as to no </s>
<s> </s>

<s> </s>
<s> this we see is occupied </s>
<s> so mark it with red counter as to no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> ditto ditto </s>
<s> as to no </s>
<s> </s>
<s> no information </s>
<s> the smaller diagram is now pretty liberally marked and now what conclusion can we read off from this </s>
<s> well it is impossible to pack such abundant information into one proposition we shall have to indulge in two this time </s>
<s> first by taking as subject we get all are that is all dragons are not scotchmen secondly by taking as subject we get all are that is all scotchmen are not dragons </s>
<s> let us now write out all together our two premisses and our brace of conclusions </s>
<s> all dragons are uncanny all scotchmen are canny </s>
<s> there all dragons are not scotchmen all scotchmen are not dragons let me mention in conclusion that you may perhaps meet with logical treatises in which it is not assumed that any thing exists at all by some are is understood to mean the attributes are compatible so that thing can have both at once and no are to mean the attributes are incompatible so that nothing can have both at once </s>
<s> in such treatises propositions have quite different meanings from what they have in our game of logic and it will be well to understand exactly what the difference is </s>
<s> first take some are </s>
<s> here we understand are to mean are as an actual fact which of course implies that some things exist </s>
<s> but they the writers of these other treatises only understand are to mean can be which does not at all imply that any exist </s>
<s> so they mean less than we do our meaning includes theirs for of course some are includes some can be but theirs does not include ours </s>
<s> for example some welsh hippopotami are heavy would be true according to these writers since the attributes welsh and heavy are quite compatible in hippopotamus but it would be false in our game since there are no welsh hippopotami to be heavy </s>
<s> secondly take no are </s>
<s> here we only understand are to mean are as an actual fact which does not at all imply that no can be </s>
<s> but they understand the proposition to mean not only that none are but that none can possibly be </s>
<s> so they mean more than we do their meaning includes ours for of course no can be includes no are but ours does not include theirs </s>
<s> for example no policemen are eight feet high would be true in our game since as an actual fact no such splendid specimens are ever found but it would be false according to these writers since the attributes belonging to the police force and eight feet high are quite compatible there is nothing to prevent policeman from growing to that height if sufficiently rubbed with rowland's macassar oil which said to make hair grow when rubbed on hair and so of course will make policeman grow when rubbed on policeman </s>
<s> thirdly take all are which consists of the two partial propositions some are and no are </s>
<s> here of course the treatises mean less than we do in the first part and more than we do in the second </s>
<s> but the two operations don't balance each other any more than you can console man for having knocked down one of his chimneys by giving him an extra door step </s>
<s> if you meet with syllogisms of this kind you may work them quite easily by the system have given you you have only to make are mean are capable of being and all will go smoothly </s>
<s> for some are will become some are capable of being that is the attributes are compatible </s>
<s> and no are will become no are capable of being that is the attributes are incompatible </s>
<s> and of course all are will become some are capable of being and none are capable of being that is the attributes are compatible and the attributes are incompatible in using the diagrams for this system you must understand red counter to mean there may possibly be something in this compartment and grey one to mean there cannot possibly be anything in this compartment </s>
<s> fallacies </s>
<s> and so you think do you that the chief use of logic in real life is to deduce conclusions from workable premisses and to satisfy yourself that the conclusions deduced by other people are correct </s>
<s> only wish it were </s>
<s> society would be much less liable to panics and other delusions and political life especially would be totally different thing if even majority of the arguments that scattered broadcast over the world were correct </s>
<s> but it is all the other way fear </s>
<s> for one workable pair of premisses mean pair that lead to logical conclusion that you meet with in reading your newspaper or magazine you will probably find five that lead to no conclusion at all and even when the premisses are workable for one instance where the writer draws correct conclusion there are probably ten where he draws an incorrect one </s>
<s> in the first case you may say the premisses are fallacious in the second the conclusion is fallacious the chief use you will find in such logical skill as this game may teach you will be in detecting fallacies of these two kinds </s>
<s> the first kind of fallacy fallacious premisses you will detect when after marking them on the larger diagram you try to transfer the marks to the smaller </s>
<s> you will take its four compartments one by one and ask for each in turn what mark can place here and in every one the answer will be no information showing that there is no conclusion at all </s>
<s> for instance all soldiers are brave some englishmen are brave </s>
<s> there some englishmen are soldiers looks uncommonly like syllogism and might easily take in less experienced logician </s>
<s> but you are not to be caught by such trick </s>
<s> you would simply set out the premisses and would then calmly remark fallacious premisses you wouldn't condescend to ask what conclusion the writer professed to draw knowing that whatever it is it must be wrong </s>
<s> you would be just as safe as that wise mother was who said mary just go up to the nursery and see what baby's doing and tell him not to do it the other kind of fallacy fallacious conclusion you will not detect till you have marked both diagrams and have read off the correct conclusion and have compared it with the conclusion which the writer has drawn </s>
<s> but mind you mustn't say fallacious conclusion simply because it is not identical with the correct one it may be part of the correct conclusion and so be quite correct as far as it goes </s>
<s> in this case you would merely remark with pitying smile defective conclusion suppose of example you were to meet with this syllogism all unselfish people are generous no misers are generous </s>
<s> there no misers are unselfish the premisses of which might be thus expressed in letters all are no are here the correct conclusion would be all are that is all unselfish people are not misers while the conclusion drawn by the writer is no are which is the same as no are and so is part of all are here you would simply say defective conclusion the same thing would happen if you were in confectioner's shop and if little boy were to come in put down twopence and march off triumphantly with single penny bun </s>
<s> you would shake your head mournfully and would remark defective conclusion </s>
<s> poor little chap and perhaps you would ask the young lady behind the counter whether she would let you eat the bun which the little boy had paid for and left behind him and perhaps she would reply sha'n but if in the above example the writer had drawn the conclusion all misers are selfish that is all are this would be going beyond his legitimate rights since it would assert the existence of which is not contained in the premisses and you would very properly say fallacious conclusion now when you read other treatises on logic you will meet with various kinds of so called fallacies which are by no means always so </s>
<s> for example if you were to put before one of these logicians the pair of premisses no honest men cheat no dishonest men are trustworthy and were to ask him what conclusion followed he would probably say none at all </s>
<s> your premisses offend against two distinct rules and are as fallacious as they can well be then suppose you were bold enough to say the conclusion is no men who cheat are trustworthy fear your logical friend would turn away hastily perhaps angry perhaps only scornful in any case the result would be unpleasant </s>
<s> advise you not to try the experiment </s>
<s> but why is this you will say </s>
<s> do you mean to tell us that all these logicians are wrong far from it dear reader </s>
<s> from their point of view they are perfectly right </s>
<s> but they do not include in their system anything like all the possible forms of syllogisms </s>
<s> they have sort of nervous dread of attributes beginning with negative particle </s>
<s> for example such propositions as all not are no are not are quite outside their system </s>
<s> and thus having from sheer nervousness excluded quantity of very useful forms they have made rules which though quite applicable to the few forms which they allow of are no use at all when you consider all possible forms </s>
<s> let us not quarrel with them dear reader </s>
<s> there is room enough in the world for both of us </s>
<s> let us quietly take our broader system and if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms and to say they are not syllogisms at all we can but stand aside and let them rush upon their fate </s>
<s> there is scarcely anything of yours upon which it is so dangerous to rush as your fate </s>

<s> we can't leave them fortune apiece </s>
<s> and money's not to be had as you know without money's worth they must work if they want to live </s>

<s> take my word for it there's no place for ignorance in these times </s>
<s> and all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you're young </s>
<s> one's got no memory afterwards worth speaking of </s>
<s> child will learn more in an hour than grown man in five </s>
<s> so those that have to learn must learn when they're young if ever they're to learn at all </s>
<s> of course that doesn't do unless children are healthy quite allow that </s>
<s> well the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless they've got good colour in their cheeks </s>
<s> and only just look at my darlings </s>
<s> why their cheeks bloom like peonies </s>
<s> well now they tell me that to keep children in health you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day and at least two half holidays in the week </s>
<s> and that's exactly our plan can assure you </s>
<s> we never go beyond six hours and every wednesday and saturday as ever is not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner </s>

<s> and that after all is the thing that one needs with snark he would joke with hyenas returning their stare with an impudent wag of the head and he once went walk paw in paw with bear just to keep up its spirits he said </s>
<s> he came as baker but owned when too late and it drove the poor bellman half mad he could only bake bridecake for which may state no materials were to be had </s>
<s> the last of the crew needs especial remark though he looked an incredible dunce he had just one idea but that one being snark the good bellman engaged him at once </s>
<s> he came as butcher but gravely declared when the ship had been sailing week he could only kill beavers </s>

<s> the beaver who happened to hear the remark protested with tears in its eyes that not even the rapture of hunting the snark could atone for that dismal surprise </s>

<s> but the danger was past they had landed at last with their boxes portmanteaus and bags yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view which consisted of chasms and crags </s>

<s> come listen my men while tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know wheresoever you go the warranted genuine snarks </s>
<s> let us take them in order </s>
<s> the first is the taste which is meagre and hollow but crisp like coat that is rather too tight in the waist with flavour of will the wisp </s>
<s> its habit of getting up late you'll agree that it carries too far when say that it frequently breakfasts at five o'clock tea and dines on the following day </s>
<s> the third is its slowness in taking jest </s>
<s> should you happen to venture on one it will sigh like thing that is deeply distressed and it always looks grave at pun </s>
<s> the fourth is its fondness for bathing machines which is constantly carries about and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes sentiment open to doubt </s>
<s> the fifth is ambition </s>
<s> it next will be right to describe each particular batch distinguishing those that have feathers and bite and those that have whiskers and scratch </s>
<s> for although common snarks do no manner of harm yet feel it my duty to say some are boojums the bellman broke off in alarm for the baker had fainted away </s>
<s> fit the third the baker's tale they roused him with muffins they roused him with ice they roused him with mustard and cress they roused him with jam and judicious advice they set him conundrums to guess </s>
<s> when at length he sat up and was able to speak his sad story he offered to tell and the bellman cried silence </s>
<s> not even shriek and excitedly tingled his bell </s>
<s> there was silence supreme </s>
<s> not shriek not scream scarcely even howl or groan as the man they called ho told his story of woe in an antediluvian tone </s>
<s> my father and mother were honest though poor skip all that cried the bellman in haste </s>
<s> if it once becomes dark there's no chance of snark we have hardly minute to waste skip forty years said the baker in tears and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark </s>
<s> dear uncle of mine after whom was named remarked when bade him farewell oh skip your dear uncle the bellman exclaimed as he angrily tingled his bell </s>
<s> he remarked to me then said that mildest of men if your snark be snark that is right fetch it home by all means you may serve it with greens and it's handy for striking light </s>
<s> you may seek it with thimbles and seek it with care you may hunt it with forks and hope you may threaten its life with railway share you may charm it with smiles and soap that's exactly the method the bellman bold in hasty parenthesis cried that's exactly the way have always been told that the capture of snarks should be tried but oh beamish nephew beware of the day if your snark be boojum </s>
<s> for then you will softly and suddenly vanish away and never be met with again it is this it is this that oppresses my soul when think of my uncle's last words and my heart is like nothing so much as bowl brimming over with quivering curds </s>
<s> it is this it is this we have had that before the bellman indignantly said </s>
<s> and the baker replied let me say it once more </s>
<s> it is this it is this that dread </s>
<s> engage with the snark every night after dark in dreamy delirious fight serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes and use it for striking light but if ever meet with boojum that day in moment of this am sure shall softly and suddenly vanish away and the notion cannot endure fit the fourth the hunting the bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow </s>
<s> if only you'd spoken before </s>
<s> it's excessively awkward to mention it now with the snark so to speak at the door </s>
<s> we should all of us grieve as you well may believe if you never were met with again but surely my man when the voyage began you might have suggested it then </s>
<s> it's excessively awkward to mention it now as think i've already remarked and the man they called hi replied with sigh informed you the day we embarked </s>
<s> you may charge me with murder or want of sense we are all of us weak at times but the slightest approach to false pretence was never among my crimes </s>
<s> said it in hebrew said it in dutch said it in german and greek but wholly forgot and it vexes me much that english is what you speak tis pitiful tale said the bellman whose face had grown longer at every word but now that you've stated the whole of your case more debate would be simply absurd </s>
<s> the rest of my speech he explained to his men you shall hear when i've leisure to speak it </s>
<s> but the snark is at hand let me tell you again </s>
<s> tis your glorious duty to seek it </s>
<s> to seek it with thimbles to seek it with care to pursue it with forks and hope to threaten its life with railway share to charm it with smiles and soap </s>
<s> for the snark's peculiar creature that won't be caught in commonplace way </s>
<s> do all that you know and try all that you don't not chance must be wasted to day </s>
<s> for england expects forbear to proceed tis maxim tremendous but trite and you'd best be unpacking the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight then the banker endorsed blank cheque which he crossed and changed his loose silver for notes </s>
<s> the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair and shook the dust out of his coats </s>
<s> the boots and the broker were sharpening spade each working the grindstone in turn but the beaver went on making lace and displayed no interest in the concern though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride and vainly proceeded to cite number of cases in which making laces had been proved an infringement of right </s>
<s> the maker of bonnets ferociously planned novel arrangement of bows while the billiard marker with quivering hand was chalking the tip of his nose </s>
<s> but the butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine with yellow kid gloves and ruff said he felt it exactly like going to dine which the bellman declared was all stuff introduce me now there's good fellow he said if we happen to meet it together and the bellman sagaciously nodding his head said that must depend on the weather the beaver went simply galumphing about at seeing the butcher so shy and even the baker though stupid and stout made an effort to wink with one eye </s>
<s> be man said the bellman in wrath as he heard the butcher beginning to sob </s>
<s> should we meet with jubjub that desperate bird we shall need all our strength for the job fit the fifth the beaver's lesson they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with railway share they charmed it with smiles and soap </s>
<s> then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan for making separate sally and had fixed on spot unfrequented by man dismal and desolate valley </s>
<s> but the very same plan to the beaver occurred it had chosen the very same place yet neither betrayed by sign or word the disgust that appeared in his face </s>
<s> each thought he was thinking of nothing but snark and the glorious work of the day and each tried to pretend that he did not remark that the other was going that way </s>
<s> but the valley grew narrow and narrower still and the evening got darker and colder till merely from nervousness not from goodwill they marched along shoulder to shoulder </s>
<s> then scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky and they knew that some danger was near the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail and even the butcher felt queer </s>
<s> he thought of his childhood left far far behind that blissful and innocent state the sound so exactly recalled to his mind pencil that squeaks on slate </s>
<s> tis the voice of the jubjub he suddenly cried </s>
<s> this man that they used to call dunce as the bellman would tell you he added with pride have uttered that sentiment once </s>
<s> tis the note of the jubjub </s>
<s> keep count entreat you will find have told it you twice </s>
<s> tis the song of the jubjub </s>
<s> the proof is complete if only i've stated it thrice the beaver had counted with scrupulous care attending to every word but it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair when the third repetition occurred </s>
<s> it felt that in spite of all possible pains it had somehow contrived to lose count and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains by reckoning up the amount </s>
<s> two added to one if that could but be done it said with one's fingers and thumbs recollecting with tears how in earlier years it had taken no pains with its sums </s>
<s> the thing can be done said the butcher think </s>
<s> the thing must be done am sure </s>
<s> the thing shall be done </s>
<s> bring me paper and ink the best there is time to procure the beaver brought paper portfolio pens and ink in unfailing supplies while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens and watched them with wondering eyes </s>
<s> so engrossed was the butcher he heeded them not as he wrote with pen in each hand and explained all the while in popular style which the beaver could well understand </s>
<s> taking three as the subject to reason about convenient number to state we add seven and ten and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight </s>
<s> the result we proceed to divide as you see by nine hundred and ninety two then subtract seventeen and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true </s>
<s> the method employed would gladly explain while have it so clear in my head if had but the time and you had but the brain but much yet remains to be said </s>
<s> in one moment i've seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery and without extra charge will give you at large lesson in natural history in his genial way he proceeded to say forgetting all laws of propriety and that giving instruction without introduction would have caused quite thrill in society as to temper the jubjub's desperate bird since it lives in perpetual passion its taste in costume is entirely absurd it is ages ahead of the fashion but it knows any friend it has met once before it never will look at bribe and in charity meetings it stands at the door and collects though it does not subscribe </s>
<s> its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs some think it keeps best in an ivory jar and some in mahogany kegs you boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue you condense it with locusts and tape still keeping one principal object in view to preserve its symmetrical shape the butcher would gladly have talked till next day but he felt that the lesson must end and he wept with delight in attempting to say he considered the beaver his friend </s>
<s> while the beaver confessed with affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books would have taught it in seventy years </s>
<s> they returned hand in hand and the bellman unmanned for moment with noble emotion said this amply repays all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean such friends as the beaver and butcher became have seldom if ever been known in winter or summer twas always the same you could never meet either alone </s>
<s> and when quarrels arose as one frequently finds quarrels will spite of every endeavour the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds and cemented their friendship for ever </s>
<s> fit the sixth the barrister's dream they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with railway share they charmed it with smiles and soap </s>
<s> but the barrister weary of proving in vain that the beaver's lace making was wrong fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt on so long </s>
<s> he dreamed that he stood in shadowy court where the snark with glass in its eye dressed in gown bands and wig was defending pig on the charge of deserting its sty </s>
<s> the witnesses proved without error or flaw that the sty was deserted when found and the judge kept explaining the state of the law in soft under current of sound </s>
<s> the indictment had never been clearly expressed and it seemed that the snark had begun and had spoken three hours before any one guessed what the pig was supposed to have done </s>
<s> the jury had each formed different view long before the indictment was read and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew one word that the others had said </s>
<s> you must know said the judge but the snark exclaimed fudge that statute is obsolete quite </s>
<s> let me tell you my friends the whole question depends on an ancient manorial right </s>
<s> in the matter of treason the pig would appear to have aided but scarcely abetted while the charge of insolvency fails it is clear if you grant the plea never indebted the fact of desertion will not dispute but its guilt as trust is removed so far as related to the costs of this suit by the alibi which has been proved </s>
<s> my poor client's fate now depends on your votes here the speaker sat down in his place and directed the judge to refer to his notes and briefly to sum up the case </s>
<s> but the judge said he never had summed up before so the snark undertook it instead and summed it so well that it came to far more than the witnesses ever had said </s>
<s> when the verdict was called for the jury declined as the word was so puzzling to spell but they ventured to hope that the snark wouldn't mind undertaking that duty as well </s>
<s> so the snark found the verdict although as it owned it was spent with the toils of the day when it said the word guilty the jury all groaned and some of them fainted away </s>
<s> then the snark pronounced sentence the judge being quite too nervous to utter word when it rose to its feet there was silence like night and the fall of pin might be heard </s>
<s> transportation for life was the sentence it gave and then to be fined forty pound the jury all cheered though the judge said he feared that the phrase was not legally sound </s>
<s> but their wild exultation was suddenly checked when the jailer informed them with tears such sentence would have not the slightest effect as the pig had been dead for some years </s>
<s> the judge left the court looking deeply disgusted but the snark though little aghast as the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted went bellowing on to the last </s>
<s> thus the barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear till he woke to the knell of furious bell which the bellman rang close at his ear </s>
<s> fit the seventh the banker's fate they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with railway share they charmed it with smiles and soap </s>
<s> and the banker inspired with courage so new it was matter for general remark rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view in his zeal to discover the snark but while he was seeking with thimbles and care bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh and grabbed at the banker who shrieked in despair for he knew it was useless to fly </s>
<s> he offered large discount he offered cheque drawn to bearer for seven pounds ten but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck and grabbed at the banker again </s>
<s> without rest or pause while those frumious jaws went savagely snapping around he skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped till fainting he fell to the ground </s>
<s> the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared led on by that fear stricken yell and the bellman remarked it is just as feared and solemnly tolled on his bell </s>
<s> he was black in the face and they scarcely could trace the least likeness to what he had been while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white wonderful thing to be seen </s>
<s> to the horror of all who were present that day </s>
<s> he uprose in full evening dress and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say what his tongue could no longer express </s>
<s> down he sank in chair ran his hands through his hair and chanted in mimsiest tones words whose utter inanity proved his insanity while he rattled couple of bones </s>
<s> leave him here to his fate it is getting so late the bellman exclaimed in fright </s>
<s> we have lost half the day </s>
<s> any further delay and we sha'nt catch snark before night fit the eighth the vanishing they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with railway share they charmed it with smiles and soap </s>
<s> they shuddered to think that the chase might fail and the beaver excited at last went bounding along on the tip of its tail for the daylight was nearly past </s>
<s> there is thingumbob shouting the bellman said he is shouting like mad only hark </s>
<s> he is waving his hands he is wagging his head he has certainly found snark they gazed in delight while the butcher exclaimed he was always desperate wag they beheld him their baker their hero unnamed on the top of neighboring crag </s>
<s> erect and sublime for one moment of time </s>
<s> in the next that wild figure they saw as if stung by spasm plunge into chasm while they waited and listened in awe </s>
<s> it's snark was the sound that first came to their ears and seemed almost too good to be true </s>
<s> then followed torrent of laughter and cheers then the ominous words it's boo then silence </s>
<s> some fancied they heard in the air weary and wandering sigh then sounded like jum but the others declare it was only breeze that went by </s>
<s> they hunted till darkness came on but they found not button or feather or mark by which they could tell that they stood on the ground where the baker had met with the snark </s>
<s> in the midst of the word he was trying to say in the midst of his laughter and glee he had softly and suddenly vanished away for the snark was boojum you see </s>

<s> he saw her once and in the glance moment's glance of meeting eyes his heart stood still in sudden trance he trembled with sweet surprise all in the waning light she stood the star of perfect womanhood </s>
<s> that summer eve his heart was light with lighter step he trod the ground and life was fairer in his sight and music was in every sound he blessed the world where there could be so beautiful thing as she </s>
<s> there once again as evening fell and stars were peering overhead two lovers met to bid farewell the western sun gleamed faint and red lost in drift of purple cloud that wrapped him like funeral shroud </s>
<s> long time the memory of that night the hand that clasped the lips that kissed the form that faded from his sight slow sinking through the tearful mist in dreamy music seemed to roll through the dark chambers of his soul </s>
<s> so after many years he came wanderer from distant shore the street the house were still the same but those he sought were there no more his burning words his hopes and fears unheeded fell on alien ears </s>
<s> only the children from their play would pause the mournful tale to hear shrinking in half alarm away or step by step would venture near to touch with timid curious hands that strange wild man from other lands </s>
<s> he sat beside the busy street there where he last had seen her face and thronging memories bitter sweet seemed yet to haunt the ancient place her footfall ever floated near her voice was ever in his ear </s>
<s> he sometimes as the daylight waned and evening mists began to roll in half soliloquy complained of that black shadow on his soul and blindly fanned with cruel care the ashes of vain despair </s>
<s> the summer fled the lonely man still lingered out the lessening days still as the night drew on would scan each passing face with closer gaze till sick at heart he turned away and sighed she will not come to day so by degrees his spirit bent to mock its own despairing cry in stern self torture to invent new luxuries of agony and people all the vacant space with visions of her perfect face </s>
<s> then for moment she was nigh he heard no step but she was there as if an angel suddenly were bodied from the viewless air and all her fine ethereal frame should fade as swiftly as it came </s>
<s> so half in fancy's sunny trance and half in misery's aching void with set and stony countenance his bitter being he enjoyed and thrust for ever from his mind the happiness he could not find </s>
<s> as when the wretch in lonely room to selfish death is madly hurled the glamour of that fatal fume shuts out the wholesome living world so all his manhood's strength and pride one sickly dream had swept aside </s>
<s> yea brother and we passed him there but yesterday in merry mood and marveled at the lordly air that shamed his beggar's attitude nor heeded that ourselves might be wretches as desperate as he who let the thought of bliss denied make havoc of our life and powers and pine in solitary pride for peace that never shall be ours because we will not work and wait in trustful patience for our fate </s>
<s> and so it chanced once more that she came by the old familiar spot the face he would have died to see bent o'er him and he knew it not too rapt in selfish grief to hear even when happiness was near </s>
<s> and pity filled her gentle breast for him that would not stir nor speak the dying crimson of the west that faintly tinged his haggard cheek fell on her as she stood and shed glory round the patient head </s>
<s> ah let him wake </s>
<s> the moments fly this awful tryst may be the last </s>
<s> and see the tear that dimmed her eye had fallen on him ere she passed she passed the crimson paled to gray and hope departed with the day </s>
<s> the heavy hours of night went by and silence quickened into sound and light slid up the eastern sky and life began its daily round but light and life for him were fled his name was numbered with the dead </s>
<s> nov illustration the path of roses </s>
<s> in the dark silence of an ancient room whose one tall window fronted to the west where through laced tendrils of hanging vine the sunset glow was fading into night sat pale lady resting weary hands upon great clasped volume and her face within her hands </s>
<s> not as in rest she bowed but large hot tears were coursing down her cheek and her low panted sobs broke awefully upon the sleeping echoes of the night </s>
<s> soon she unclasp'd the volume once again and read the words in tone of agony as in self torture weeping as she read he crowns the glory of his race he prayeth but in some fit place to meet his foeman face to face and battling for the true the right from ruddy dawn to purple night to perish in the midmost fight where hearts are fierce and hands are strong where peals the bugle loud and long where blood is dropping in the throng still with dim and glazing eye to watch the tide of victory to hear in death the battle cry then gathered grandly to his grave to rest among the true and brave in holy ground where yew trees wave where from church windows sculptured fair float out upon the evening air the note of praise the voice of prayer where no vain marble mockery insults with loud and boastful lie the simple soldier's memory where sometimes little children go and read in whisper'd accent slow the name of him who sleeps below her voice died out like one in dreams she sat </s>

<s> but there was one that ever to and fro moved with light footfall purely calm her face and those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom still as she went she ministered to each comfort and counsel cooled the fevered brow with softest touch and in the listening ear of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace </s>

<s> through the looking glass by lewis carroll the millennium fulcrum edition chapter </s>
<s> looking glass house one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it it was the black kitten's fault entirely </s>
<s> for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour and bearing it pretty well considering so you see that it couldn't have had any hand in the mischief </s>
<s> the way dinah washed her children's faces was this first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over the wrong way beginning at the nose and just now as said she was hard at work on the white kitten which was lying quite still and trying to purr no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good </s>
<s> but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon and so while alice was sitting curled up in corner of the great arm chair half talking to herself and half asleep the kitten had been having grand game of romps with the ball of worsted alice had been trying to wind up and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again and there it was spread over the hearth rug all knots and tangles with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle </s>
<s> oh you wicked little thing cried alice catching up the kitten and giving it little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace </s>
<s> really dinah ought to have taught you better manners </s>
<s> you ought dinah you know you ought she added looking reproachfully at the old cat and speaking in as cross voice as she could manage and then she scrambled back into the arm chair taking the kitten and the worsted with her and began winding up the ball again </s>
<s> but she didn't get on very fast as she was talking all the time sometimes to the kitten and sometimes to herself </s>
<s> kitty sat very demurely on her knee pretending to watch the progress of the winding and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball as if it would be glad to help if it might </s>
<s> do you know what to morrow is kitty alice began </s>
<s> you'd have guessed if you'd been up in the window with me only dinah was making you tidy so you couldn't </s>
<s> was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire and it wants plenty of sticks kitty </s>
<s> only it got so cold and it snowed so they had to leave off </s>
<s> never mind kitty we'll go and see the bonfire to morrow here alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten's neck just to see how it would look this led to scramble in which the ball rolled down upon the floor and yards and yards of it got unwound again </s>
<s> do you know was so angry kitty alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again when saw all the mischief you had been doing was very nearly opening the window and putting you out into the snow </s>
<s> and you'd have deserved it you little mischievous darling </s>
<s> what have you got to say for yourself </s>
<s> now don't interrupt me she went on holding up one finger </s>
<s> i'm going to tell you all your faults </s>
<s> number one you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this morning </s>
<s> now you can't deny it kitty heard you </s>
<s> what's that you say pretending that the kitten was speaking her paw went into your eye </s>
<s> well that's your fault for keeping your eyes open if you'd shut them tight up it wouldn't have happened </s>
<s> now don't make any more excuses but listen </s>
<s> number two you pulled snowdrop away by the tail just as had put down the saucer of milk before her </s>
<s> what you were thirsty were you </s>
<s> how do you know she wasn't thirsty too </s>
<s> now for number three you unwound every bit of the worsted while wasn't looking </s>
<s> that's three faults kitty and you've not been punished for any of them yet </s>
<s> you know i'm saving up all your punishments for wednesday week suppose they had saved up all my punishments she went on talking more to herself than the kitten </s>
<s> what would they do at the end of year </s>
<s> should be sent to prison suppose when the day came </s>
<s> or let me see suppose each punishment was to be going without dinner then when the miserable day came should have to go without fifty dinners at once </s>
<s> well shouldn't mind that much </s>
<s> i'd far rather go without them than eat them </s>
<s> do you hear the snow against the window panes kitty </s>
<s> how nice and soft it sounds </s>
<s> just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside </s>
<s> wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields that it kisses them so gently </s>
<s> and then it covers them up snug you know with white quilt and perhaps it says go to sleep darlings till the summer comes again and when they wake up in the summer kitty they dress themselves all in green and dance about whenever the wind blows oh that's very pretty cried alice dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands </s>
<s> and do so wish it was true </s>
<s> i'm sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn when the leaves are getting brown </s>
<s> kitty can you play chess </s>
<s> now don't smile my dear i'm asking it seriously </s>
<s> because when we were playing just now you watched just as if you understood it and when said check you purred </s>
<s> well it was nice check kitty and really might have won if it hadn't been for that nasty knight that came wiggling down among my pieces </s>
<s> kitty dear let's pretend and here wish could tell you half the things alice used to say beginning with her favourite phrase let's pretend she had had quite long argument with her sister only the day before all because alice had begun with let's pretend we're kings and queens and her sister who liked being very exact had argued that they couldn't because there were only two of them and alice had been reduced at last to say well you can be one of them then and i'll be all the rest and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear nurse </s>
<s> do let's pretend that i'm hungry hyaena and you're bone but this is taking us away from alice's speech to the kitten </s>
<s> let's pretend that you're the red queen kitty </s>
<s> do you know think if you sat up and folded your arms you'd look exactly like her </s>
<s> now do try there's dear and alice got the red queen off the table and set it up before the kitten as model for it to imitate however the thing didn't succeed principally alice said because the kitten wouldn't fold its arms properly </s>
<s> so to punish it she held it up to the looking glass that it might see how sulky it was and if you're not good directly she added i'll put you through into looking glass house </s>
<s> how would you like that now if you'll only attend kitty and not talk so much i'll tell you all my ideas about looking glass house </s>
<s> first there's the room you can see through the glass that's just the same as our drawing room only the things go the other way </s>
<s> can see all of it when get upon chair all but the bit behind the fireplace </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> do so wish could see that bit </s>
<s> want so much to know whether they've fire in the winter you never can tell you know unless our fire smokes and then smoke comes up in that room too but that may be only pretence just to make it look as if they had fire </s>
<s> well then the books are something like our books only the words go the wrong way know that because i've held up one of our books to the glass and then they hold up one in the other room </s>
<s> how would you like to live in looking glass house kitty </s>
<s> wonder if they'd give you milk in there </s>
<s> perhaps looking glass milk isn't good to drink but oh kitty </s>
<s> now we come to the passage </s>
<s> you can just see little peep of the passage in looking glass house if you leave the door of our drawing room wide open and it's very like our passage as far as you can see only you know it may be quite different on beyond </s>
<s> oh kitty </s>
<s> how nice it would be if we could only get through into looking glass house </s>
<s> i'm sure it's got oh </s>
<s> such beautiful things in it </s>
<s> let's pretend there's way of getting through into it somehow kitty </s>
<s> let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze so that we can get through </s>
<s> why it's turning into sort of mist now declare </s>
<s> it'll be easy enough to get through she was up on the chimney piece while she said this though she hardly knew how she had got there </s>
<s> and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away just like bright silvery mist </s>
<s> in another moment alice was through the glass and had jumped lightly down into the looking glass room </s>
<s> the very first thing she did was to look whether there was fire in the fireplace and she was quite pleased to find that there was real one blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind </s>
<s> so shall be as warm here as was in the old room thought alice warmer in fact because there'll be no one here to scold me away from the fire </s>
<s> oh what fun it'll be when they see me through the glass in here and can't get at me then she began looking about and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting but that all the rest was as different as possible </s>
<s> for instance the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive and the very clock on the chimney piece you know you can only see the back of it in the looking glass had got the face of little old man and grinned at her </s>
<s> they don't keep this room so tidy as the other alice thought to herself as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders but in another moment with little oh of surprise she was down on her hands and knees watching them </s>
<s> the chessmen were walking about two and two </s>
<s> here are the red king and the red queen alice said in whisper for fear of frightening them and there are the white king and the white queen sitting on the edge of the shovel and here are two castles walking arm in arm don't think they can hear me she went on as she put her head closer down and i'm nearly sure they can't see me </s>
<s> feel somehow as if were invisible here something began squeaking on the table behind alice and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and begin kicking she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next </s>
<s> it is the voice of my child the white queen cried out as she rushed past the king so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders </s>
<s> my precious lily </s>
<s> my imperial kitten and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender </s>
<s> imperial fiddlestick said the king rubbing his nose which had been hurt by the fall </s>
<s> he had right to be little annoyed with the queen for he was covered with ashes from head to foot </s>
<s> alice was very anxious to be of use and as the poor little lily was nearly screaming herself into fit she hastily picked up the queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter </s>
<s> the queen gasped and sat down the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little lily in silence </s>
<s> as soon as she had recovered her breath little she called out to the white king who was sitting sulkily among the ashes mind the volcano what volcano said the king looking up anxiously into the fire as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one </s>

<s> mind you come up the regular way don't get blown up alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar till at last she said why you'll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate </s>
<s> i'd far better help you hadn't but the king took no notice of the question it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her </s>
<s> so alice picked him up very gently and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the queen that she mightn't take his breath away but before she put him on the table she thought she might as well dust him little he was so covered with ashes </s>
<s> she said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such face as the king made when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand and being dusted he was far too much astonished to cry out but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger and rounder and rounder till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> please don't make such faces my dear she cried out quite forgetting that the king couldn't hear her </s>
<s> you make me laugh so that can hardly hold you </s>
<s> and don't keep your mouth so wide open </s>
<s> all the ashes will get into it there now think you're tidy enough she added as she smoothed his hair and set him upon the table near the queen </s>
<s> the king immediately fell flat on his back and lay perfectly still and alice was little alarmed at what she had done and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him </s>
<s> however she could find nothing but bottle of ink and when she got back with it she found he had recovered and he and the queen were talking together in frightened whisper so low that alice could hardly hear what they said </s>
<s> the king was saying assure you my dear turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers to which the queen replied you haven't got any whiskers the horror of that moment the king went on shall never never forget you will though the queen said if you don't make memorandum of it alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous memorandum book out of his pocket and began writing </s>
<s> sudden thought struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some way over his shoulder and began writing for him </s>
<s> the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything but alice was too strong for him and at last he panted out my dear </s>
<s> really must get thinner pencil </s>
<s> can't manage this one bit it writes all manner of things that don't intend what manner of things said the queen looking over the book in which alice had put the white knight is sliding down the poker </s>
<s> he balances very badly that's not memorandum of your feelings there was book lying near alice on the table and while she sat watching the white king for she was still little anxious about him and had the ink all ready to throw over him in case he fainted again she turned over the leaves to find some part that she could read for it's all in some language don't know she said to herself </s>

<s> it seems very pretty she said when she had finished it but it's rather hard to understand you see she didn't like to confess even to herself that she couldn't make it out at all somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas only don't exactly know what they are </s>
<s> however somebody killed something that's clear at any rate but oh thought alice suddenly jumping up if don't make haste shall have to go back through the looking glass before i've seen what the rest of the house is like </s>
<s> let's have look at the garden first she was out of the room in moment and ran down stairs or at least it wasn't exactly running but new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily as alice said to herself </s>
<s> she just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand rail and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet then she floated on through the hall and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way if she hadn't caught hold of the door post </s>
<s> she was getting little giddy with so much floating in the air and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way </s>
<s> chapter ii </s>
<s> the garden of live flowers should see the garden far better said alice to herself if could get to the top of that hill and here's path that leads straight to it at least no it doesn't do that after going few yards along the path and turning several sharp corners but suppose it will at last </s>
<s> but how curiously it twists </s>
<s> it's more like corkscrew than path </s>
<s> well this turn goes to the hill suppose no it doesn't </s>
<s> this goes straight back to the house </s>
<s> well then i'll try it the other way and so she did wandering up and down and trying turn after turn but always coming back to the house do what she would </s>
<s> indeed once when she turned corner rather more quickly than usual she ran against it before she could stop herself </s>
<s> it's no use talking about it alice said looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her </s>
<s> i'm not going in again yet </s>
<s> know should have to get through the looking glass again back into the old room and there'd be an end of all my adventures so resolutely turning her back upon the house she set out once more down the path determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill </s>
<s> for few minutes all went on well and she was just saying really shall do it this time when the path gave sudden twist and shook itself as she described it afterwards and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door </s>
<s> oh it's too bad she cried </s>
<s> never saw such house for getting in the way </s>
<s> never however there was the hill full in sight so there was nothing to be done but start again </s>
<s> this time she came upon large flower bed with border of daisies and willow tree growing in the middle </s>
<s> tiger lily said alice addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind wish you could talk we can talk said the tiger lily when there's anybody worth talking to alice was so astonished that she could not speak for minute it quite seemed to take her breath away </s>
<s> at length as the tiger lily only went on waving about she spoke again in timid voice almost in whisper </s>
<s> and can all the flowers talk as well as you can said the tiger lily </s>
<s> and great deal louder it isn't manners for us to begin you know said the rose and really was wondering when you'd speak </s>
<s> said to myself her face has got some sense in it though it's not clever one still you're the right colour and that goes long way don't care about the colour the tiger lily remarked </s>
<s> if only her petals curled up little more she'd be all right alice didn't like being criticised so she began asking questions </s>
<s> aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you there's the tree in the middle said the rose what else is it good for but what could it do if any danger came alice asked </s>
<s> it says bough wough cried daisy that's why its branches are called boughs didn't you know that cried another daisy and here they all began shouting together till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices </s>
<s> silence every one of you cried the tiger lily waving itself passionately from side to side and trembling with excitement </s>
<s> they know can't get at them it panted bending its quivering head towards alice or they wouldn't dare to do it never mind alice said in soothing tone and stooping down to the daisies who were just beginning again she whispered if you don't hold your tongues i'll pick you there was silence in moment and several of the pink daisies turned white </s>
<s> that's right said the tiger lily </s>
<s> the daisies are worst of all </s>
<s> when one speaks they all begin together and it's enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on how is it you can all talk so nicely alice said hoping to get it into better temper by compliment </s>
<s> i've been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk put your hand down and feel the ground said the tiger lily </s>
<s> then you'll know why alice did so </s>
<s> it's very hard she said but don't see what that has to do with it in most gardens the tiger lily said they make the beds too soft so that the flowers are always asleep this sounded very good reason and alice was quite pleased to know it </s>
<s> never thought of that before she said </s>
<s> it's my opinion that you never think at all the rose said in rather severe tone </s>
<s> never saw anybody that looked stupider violet said so suddenly that alice quite jumped for it hadn't spoken before </s>
<s> hold your tongue cried the tiger lily </s>
<s> as if you ever saw anybody </s>
<s> you keep your head under the leaves and snore away there till you know no more what's going on in the world than if you were bud are there any more people in the garden besides me alice said not choosing to notice the rose's last remark </s>
<s> there's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you said the rose </s>
<s> wonder how you do it you're always wondering said the tiger lily but she's more bushy than you are is she like me alice asked eagerly for the thought crossed her mind there's another little girl in the garden somewhere well she has the same awkward shape as you the rose said but she's redder and her petals are shorter think her petals are done up close almost like dahlia the tiger lily interrupted not tumbled about anyhow like yours but that's not your fault the rose added kindly you're beginning to fade you know and then one can't help one's petals getting little untidy alice didn't like this idea at all so to change the subject she asked does she ever come out here daresay you'll see her soon said the rose </s>
<s> she's one of the thorny kind where does she wear the thorns alice asked with some curiosity </s>
<s> why all round her head of course the rose replied </s>
<s> was wondering you hadn't got some too </s>
<s> thought it was the regular rule she's coming cried the larkspur </s>
<s> hear her footstep thump thump thump along the gravel walk alice looked round eagerly and found that it was the red queen </s>
<s> she's grown good deal was her first remark </s>
<s> she had indeed when alice first found her in the ashes she had been only three inches high and here she was half head taller than alice herself </s>
<s> it's the fresh air that does it said the rose wonderfully fine air it is out here think i'll go and meet her said alice for though the flowers were interesting enough she felt that it would be far grander to have talk with real queen </s>
<s> you can't possibly do that said the rose should advise you to walk the other way this sounded nonsense to alice so she said nothing but set off at once towards the red queen </s>
<s> to her surprise she lost sight of her in moment and found herself walking in at the front door again </s>
<s> little provoked she drew back and after looking everywhere for the queen whom she spied out at last long way off she thought she would try the plan this time of walking in the opposite direction </s>
<s> it succeeded beautifully </s>
<s> she had not been walking minute before she found herself face to face with the red queen and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at </s>
<s> where do you come from said the red queen </s>
<s> and where are you going </s>
<s> look up speak nicely and don't twiddle your fingers all the time alice attended to all these directions and explained as well as she could that she had lost her way </s>
<s> don't know what you mean by your way said the queen all the ways about here belong to me but why did you come out here at all she added in kinder tone </s>
<s> curtsey while you're thinking what to say it saves time alice wondered little at this but she was too much in awe of the queen to disbelieve it </s>
<s> i'll try it when go home she thought to herself the next time i'm little late for dinner it's time for you to answer now the queen said looking at her watch open your mouth little wider when you speak and always say your majesty only wanted to see what the garden was like your majesty that's right said the queen patting her on the head which alice didn't like at all though when you say garden i've seen gardens compared with which this would be wilderness alice didn't dare to argue the point but went on and thought i'd try and find my way to the top of that hill when you say hill the queen interrupted could show you hills in comparison with which you'd call that valley no shouldn't said alice surprised into contradicting her at last hill can't be valley you know </s>
<s> that would be nonsense the red queen shook her head you may call it nonsense if you like she said but i've heard nonsense compared with which that would be as sensible as dictionary alice curtseyed again as she was afraid from the queen's tone that she was little offended and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill </s>
<s> for some minutes alice stood without speaking looking out in all directions over the country and most curious country it was </s>
<s> there were number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side and the ground between was divided up into squares by number of little green hedges that reached from brook to brook </s>
<s> declare it's marked out just like large chessboard alice said at last </s>
<s> there ought to be some men moving about somewhere and so there are she added in tone of delight and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on </s>
<s> it's great huge game of chess that's being played all over the world if this is the world at all you know </s>
<s> oh what fun it is </s>
<s> how wish was one of them </s>
<s> wouldn't mind being pawn if only might join though of course should like to be queen best she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this but her companion only smiled pleasantly and said that's easily managed </s>
<s> you can be the white queen's pawn if you like as lily's too young to play and you're in the second square to begin with when you get to the eighth square you'll be queen just at this moment somehow or other they began to run </s>
<s> alice never could quite make out in thinking it over afterwards how it was that they began all she remembers is that they were running hand in hand and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her and still the queen kept crying faster </s>
<s> faster but alice felt she could not go faster though she had not breath left to say so </s>
<s> the most curious part of the thing was that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all however fast they went they never seemed to pass anything </s>
<s> wonder if all the things move along with us thought poor puzzled alice </s>
<s> and the queen seemed to guess her thoughts for she cried faster </s>
<s> don't try to talk not that alice had any idea of doing that </s>
<s> she felt as if she would never be able to talk again she was getting so much out of breath and still the queen cried faster </s>
<s> faster and dragged her along </s>
<s> are we nearly there alice managed to pant out at last </s>
<s> nearly there the queen repeated </s>
<s> why we passed it ten minutes ago </s>
<s> faster and they ran on for time in silence with the wind whistling in alice's ears and almost blowing her hair off her head she fancied </s>
<s> now </s>
<s> now cried the queen </s>
<s> faster </s>
<s> faster and they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air hardly touching the ground with their feet till suddenly just as alice was getting quite exhausted they stopped and she found herself sitting on the ground breathless and giddy </s>
<s> the queen propped her up against tree and said kindly you may rest little now alice looked round her in great surprise </s>
<s> why do believe we've been under this tree the whole time </s>
<s> everything's just as it was of course it is said the queen what would you have it well in our country said alice still panting little you'd generally get to somewhere else if you ran very fast for long time as we've been doing slow sort of country said the queen </s>
<s> now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place </s>
<s> if you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that i'd rather not try please said alice </s>
<s> i'm quite content to stay here only am so hot and thirsty know what you'd like the queen said good naturedly taking little box out of her pocket </s>
<s> have biscuit alice thought it would not be civil to say no though it wasn't at all what she wanted </s>
<s> so she took it and ate it as well as she could and it was very dry and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life </s>
<s> while you're refreshing yourself said the queen i'll just take the measurements and she took ribbon out of her pocket marked in inches and began measuring the ground and sticking little pegs in here and there </s>
<s> at the end of two yards she said putting in peg to mark the distance shall give you your directions have another biscuit no thank you said alice one's quite enough thirst quenched hope said the queen </s>
<s> alice did not know what to say to this but luckily the queen did not wait for an answer but went on </s>
<s> at the end of three yards shall repeat them for fear of your forgetting them </s>
<s> at the end of four shall say good bye </s>
<s> and at the end of five shall go she had got all the pegs put in by this time and alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree and then began slowly walking down the row </s>
<s> at the two yard peg she faced round and said pawn goes two squares in its first move you know </s>
<s> so you'll go very quickly through the third square by railway should think and you'll find yourself in the fourth square in no time </s>
<s> well that square belongs to tweedledum and tweedledee the fifth is mostly water the sixth belongs to humpty dumpty but you make no remark didn't know had to make one just then alice faltered out </s>
<s> you should have said it's extremely kind of you to tell me all this however we'll suppose it said the seventh square is all forest however one of the knights will show you the way and in the eighth square we shall be queens together and it's all feasting and fun alice got up and curtseyed and sat down again </s>
<s> at the next peg the queen turned again and this time she said speak in french when you can't think of the english for thing turn out your toes as you walk and remember who you are she did not wait for alice to curtsey this time but walked on quickly to the next peg where she turned for moment to say good bye and then hurried on to the last </s>
<s> how it happened alice never knew but exactly as she came to the last peg she was gone </s>
<s> whether she vanished into the air or whether she ran quickly into the wood and she can run very fast thought alice there was no way of guessing but she was gone and alice began to remember that she was pawn and that it would soon be time for her to move </s>
<s> chapter iii </s>
<s> looking glass insects of course the first thing to do was to make grand survey of the country she was going to travel through </s>
<s> it's something very like learning geography thought alice as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see little further </s>
<s> principal rivers there are none </s>
<s> principal mountains i'm on the only one but don't think it's got any name </s>
<s> principal towns why what are those creatures making honey down there </s>
<s> they can't be bees nobody ever saw bees mile off you know and for some time she stood silent watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers poking its proboscis into them just as if it was regular bee thought alice </s>
<s> however this was anything but regular bee in fact it was an elephant as alice soon found out though the idea quite took her breath away at first </s>
<s> and what enormous flowers they must be was her next idea </s>
<s> something like cottages with the roofs taken off and stalks put to them and what quantities of honey they must make </s>
<s> think i'll go down and no won't just yet she went on checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly </s>
<s> it'll never do to go down among them without good long branch to brush them away and what fun it'll be when they ask me how like my walk </s>
<s> shall say oh like it well enough here came the favourite little toss of the head only it was so dusty and hot and the elephants did tease so think i'll go down the other way she said after pause and perhaps may visit the elephants later on </s>
<s> besides do so want to get into the third square so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks </s>
<s> tickets please said the guard putting his head in at the window </s>
<s> in moment everybody was holding out ticket they were about the same size as the people and quite seemed to fill the carriage </s>
<s> now then </s>
<s> show your ticket child the guard went on looking angrily at alice </s>
<s> and great many voices all said together like the chorus of song thought alice don't keep him waiting child </s>
<s> why his time is worth thousand pounds minute i'm afraid haven't got one alice said in frightened tone there wasn't ticket office where came from and again the chorus of voices went on </s>
<s> there wasn't room for one where she came from </s>
<s> the land there is worth thousand pounds an inch don't make excuses said the guard you should have bought one from the engine driver and once more the chorus of voices went on with the man that drives the engine </s>
<s> why the smoke alone is worth thousand pounds puff alice thought to herself then there's no use in speaking the voices didn't join in this time as she hadn't spoken but to her great surprise they all thought in chorus hope you understand what thinking in chorus means for must confess that don't better say nothing at all </s>
<s> language is worth thousand pounds word shall dream about thousand pounds tonight know shall thought alice </s>
<s> all this time the guard was looking at her first through telescope then through microscope and then through an opera glass </s>
<s> at last he said you're travelling the wrong way and shut up the window and went away </s>
<s> so young child said the gentleman sitting opposite to her he was dressed in white paper ought to know which way she's going even if she doesn't know her own name goat that was sitting next to the gentleman in white shut his eyes and said in loud voice she ought to know her way to the ticket office even if she doesn't know her alphabet there was beetle sitting next to the goat it was very queer carriage full of passengers altogether and as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn he went on with she'll have to go back from here as luggage alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the beetle but hoarse voice spoke next </s>
<s> change engines it said and was obliged to leave off </s>
<s> it sounds like horse alice thought to herself </s>
<s> and an extremely small voice close to her ear said you might make joke on that something about horse and hoarse you know then very gentle voice in the distance said she must be labelled lass with care you know and after that other voices went on what number of people there are in the carriage thought alice saying she must go by post as she's got head on her she must be sent as message by the telegraph she must draw the train herself the rest of the way and so on </s>
<s> but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear never mind what they all say my dear but take return ticket every time the train stops indeed shan't alice said rather impatiently </s>
<s> don't belong to this railway journey at all was in wood just now and wish could get back there you might make joke on that said the little voice close to her ear something about you would if you could you know don't tease so said alice looking about in vain to see where the voice came from if you're so anxious to have joke made why don't you make one yourself the little voice sighed deeply it was very unhappy evidently and alice would have said something pitying to comfort it if it would only sigh like other people she thought </s>
<s> but this was such wonderfully small sigh that she wouldn't have heard it at all if it hadn't come quite close to her ear </s>
<s> the consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature </s>
<s> know you are friend the little voice went on dear friend and an old friend </s>
<s> and you won't hurt me though am an insect what kind of insect alice inquired little anxiously </s>
<s> what she really wanted to know was whether it could sting or not but she thought this wouldn't be quite civil question to ask </s>
<s> what then you don't the little voice began when it was drowned by shrill scream from the engine and everybody jumped up in alarm alice among the rest </s>
<s> the horse who had put his head out of the window quietly drew it in and said it's only brook we have to jump over everybody seemed satisfied with this though alice felt little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all </s>
<s> however it'll take us into the fourth square that's some comfort she said to herself </s>
<s> in another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand which happened to be the goat's beard </s>
<s> but the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it and she found herself sitting quietly under tree while the gnat for that was the insect she had been talking to was balancing itself on twig just over her head and fanning her with its wings </s>
<s> it certainly was very large gnat about the size of chicken alice thought </s>
<s> still she couldn't feel nervous with it after they had been talking together so long </s>
<s> then you don't like all insects the gnat went on as quietly as if nothing had happened </s>
<s> like them when they can talk alice said </s>
<s> none of them ever talk where come from what sort of insects do you rejoice in where you come from the gnat inquired </s>
<s> don't rejoice in insects at all alice explained because i'm rather afraid of them at least the large kinds </s>
<s> but can tell you the names of some of them of course they answer to their names the gnat remarked carelessly </s>
<s> never knew them to do it what's the use of their having names the gnat said if they won't answer to them no use to them said alice but it's useful to the people who name them suppose </s>
<s> if not why do things have names at all can't say the gnat replied </s>
<s> further on in the wood down there they've got no names however go on with your list of insects you're wasting time well there's the horse fly alice began counting off the names on her fingers </s>
<s> all right said the gnat half way up that bush you'll see rocking horse fly if you look </s>
<s> it's made entirely of wood and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch what does it live on alice asked with great curiosity </s>
<s> sap and sawdust said the gnat </s>
<s> go on with the list alice looked up at the rocking horse fly with great interest and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted it looked so bright and sticky and then she went on </s>
<s> and there's the dragon fly look on the branch above your head said the gnat and there you'll find snap dragon fly </s>
<s> its body is made of plum pudding its wings of holly leaves and its head is raisin burning in brandy and what does it live on frumenty and mince pie the gnat replied and it makes its nest in christmas box and then there's the butterfly alice went on after she had taken good look at the insect with its head on fire and had thought to herself wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles because they want to turn into snap dragon flies crawling at your feet said the gnat alice drew her feet back in some alarm you may observe bread and butterfly </s>
<s> its wings are thin slices of bread and butter its body is crust and its head is lump of sugar and what does it live on weak tea with cream in it new difficulty came into alice's head </s>
<s> supposing it couldn't find any she suggested </s>
<s> then it would die of course but that must happen very often alice remarked thoughtfully </s>
<s> it always happens said the gnat </s>
<s> after this alice was silent for minute or two pondering </s>
<s> the gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head at last it settled again and remarked suppose you don't want to lose your name no indeed alice said little anxiously </s>
<s> and yet don't know the gnat went on in careless tone only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it </s>
<s> for instance if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons she would call out come here and there she would have to leave off because there wouldn't be any name for her to call and of course you wouldn't have to go you know that would never do i'm sure said alice the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that </s>
<s> if she couldn't remember my name she'd call me miss as the servants do well if she said miss and didn't say anything more the gnat remarked of course you'd miss your lessons </s>
<s> that's joke </s>
<s> wish you had made it why do you wish had made it alice asked </s>
<s> it's very bad one but the gnat only sighed deeply while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks </s>
<s> you shouldn't make jokes alice said if it makes you so unhappy then came another of those melancholy little sighs and this time the poor gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away for when alice looked up there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig and as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long she got up and walked on </s>
<s> she very soon came to an open field with wood on the other side of it it looked much darker than the last wood and alice felt little timid about going into it </s>
<s> however on second thoughts she made up her mind to go on for certainly won't go back she thought to herself and this was the only way to the eighth square </s>
<s> this must be the wood she said thoughtfully to herself where things have no names </s>
<s> wonder what'll become of my name when go in </s>
<s> shouldn't like to lose it at all because they'd have to give me another and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one </s>
<s> but then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name </s>
<s> that's just like the advertisements you know when people lose dogs answers to the name of dash had on brass collar just fancy calling everything you met alice till one of them answered </s>
<s> only they wouldn't answer at all if they were wise she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood it looked very cool and shady </s>
<s> well at any rate it's great comfort she said as she stepped under the trees after being so hot to get into the into what she went on rather surprised at not being able to think of the word </s>
<s> mean to get under the under the under this you know putting her hand on the trunk of the tree </s>
<s> what does it call itself wonder </s>
<s> do believe it's got no name why to be sure it hasn't she stood silent for minute thinking then she suddenly began again </s>
<s> then it really has happened after all </s>
<s> and now who am </s>
<s> will remember if can </s>
<s> i'm determined to do it but being determined didn't help much and all she could say after great deal of puzzling was know it begins with just then fawn came wandering by it looked at alice with its large gentle eyes but didn't seem at all frightened </s>
<s> here then </s>
<s> here then alice said as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it but it only started back little and then stood looking at her again </s>
<s> what do you call yourself the fawn said at last </s>
<s> such soft sweet voice it had </s>
<s> wish knew thought poor alice </s>
<s> she answered rather sadly nothing just now think again it said that won't do alice thought but nothing came of it </s>
<s> please would you tell me what you call yourself she said timidly </s>
<s> think that might help little i'll tell you if you'll move little further on the fawn said </s>
<s> can't remember here so they walked on together though the wood alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the fawn till they came out into another open field and here the fawn gave sudden bound into the air and shook itself free from alice's arms </s>
<s> i'm fawn it cried out in voice of delight and dear me </s>

<s> however know my name now she said that's some comfort </s>
<s> alice alice won't forget it again </s>
<s> and now which of these finger posts ought to follow wonder it was not very difficult question to answer as there was only one road through the wood and the two finger posts both pointed along it </s>

<s> she went on and on long way but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger posts pointing the same way one marked to tweedledum's house and the other to the house of tweedledee do believe said alice at last that they live in the same house </s>

<s> i'll just call and say how d'you do and ask them the way out of the wood </s>

<s> chapter iv </s>
<s> tweedledum and tweedledee they were standing under tree each with an arm round the other's neck and alice knew which was which in moment because one of them had dum embroidered on his collar and the other dee suppose they've each got tweedle round at the back of the collar she said to herself </s>
<s> they stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive and she was just looking round to see if the word tweedle was written at the back of each collar when she was startled by voice coming from the one marked dum if you think we're wax works he said you ought to pay you know </s>
<s> wax works weren't made to be looked at for nothing nohow contrariwise added the one marked dee if you think we're alive you ought to speak i'm sure i'm very sorry was all alice could say for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of clock and she could hardly help saying them out loud tweedledum and tweedledee agreed to have battle for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle </s>
<s> just then flew down monstrous crow as black as tar barrel which frightened both the heroes so they quite forgot their quarrel know what you're thinking about said tweedledum but it isn't so nohow contrariwise continued tweedledee if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isn't it ain't </s>
<s> that's logic was thinking alice said very politely which is the best way out of this wood it's getting so dark </s>
<s> would you tell me please but the little men only looked at each other and grinned </s>
<s> they looked so exactly like couple of great schoolboys that alice couldn't help pointing her finger at tweedledum and saying first boy nohow tweedledum cried out briskly and shut his mouth up again with snap </s>
<s> next boy said alice passing on to tweedledee though she felt quite certain he would only shout out contrariwise and so he did </s>
<s> you've been wrong cried tweedledum </s>
<s> the first thing in visit is to say how d'ye do and shake hands and here the two brothers gave each other hug and then they held out the two hands that were free to shake hands with her </s>
<s> alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first for fear of hurting the other one's feelings so as the best way out of the difficulty she took hold of both hands at once the next moment they were dancing round in ring </s>
<s> this seemed quite natural she remembered afterwards and she was not even surprised to hear music playing it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing and it was done as well as she could make it out by the branches rubbing one across the other like fiddles and fiddle sticks </s>
<s> but it certainly was funny alice said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of all this to find myself singing here we go round the mulberry bush don't know when began it but somehow felt as if i'd been singing it long long time the other two dancers were fat and very soon out of breath </s>
<s> four times round is enough for one dance tweedledum panted out and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun the music stopped at the same moment </s>
<s> then they let go of alice's hands and stood looking at her for minute there was rather awkward pause as alice didn't know how to begin conversation with people she had just been dancing with </s>
<s> it would never do to say how d'ye do now she said to herself we seem to have got beyond that somehow hope you're not much tired she said at last </s>
<s> nohow </s>
<s> and thank you very much for asking said tweedledum </s>
<s> so much obliged added tweedledee </s>
<s> you like poetry ye es pretty well some poetry alice said doubtfully </s>
<s> would you tell me which road leads out of the wood what shall repeat to her said tweedledee looking round at tweedledum with great solemn eyes and not noticing alice's question </s>
<s> the walrus and the carpenter is the longest tweedledum replied giving his brother an affectionate hug </s>
<s> tweedledee began instantly the sun was shining here alice ventured to interrupt him </s>
<s> if it's very long she said as politely as she could would you please tell me first which road tweedledee smiled gently and began again the sun was shining on the sea shining with all his might he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright and this was odd because it was the middle of the night </s>
<s> the moon was shining sulkily because she thought the sun had got no business to be there after the day was done it's very rude of him she said to come and spoil the fun the sea was wet as wet could be the sands were dry as dry </s>
<s> you could not see cloud because no cloud was in the sky no birds were flying over head there were no birds to fly </s>
<s> the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand if this were only cleared away they said it would be grand if seven maids with seven mops swept it for half year do you suppose the walrus said that they could get it clear doubt it said the carpenter and shed bitter tear </s>
<s> oysters come and walk with us the walrus did beseech </s>
<s> pleasant walk pleasant talk along the briny beach we cannot do with more than four to give hand to each the eldest oyster looked at him </s>
<s> but never word he said the eldest oyster winked his eye and shook his heavy head meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster bed </s>
<s> but four young oysters hurried up all eager for the treat their coats were brushed their faces washed their shoes were clean and neat and this was odd because you know they hadn't any feet </s>
<s> four other oysters followed them and yet another four and thick and fast they came at last and more and more and more all hopping through the frothy waves and scrambling to the shore </s>
<s> the walrus and the carpenter walked on mile or so and then they rested on rock conveniently low and all the little oysters stood and waited in row </s>
<s> the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings but wait bit the oysters cried before we have our chat for some of us are out of breath and all of us are fat no hurry said the carpenter </s>
<s> they thanked him much for that </s>
<s> loaf of bread the walrus said is what we chiefly need pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed now if you're ready oysters dear we can begin to feed but not on us the oysters cried turning little blue after such kindness that would be dismal thing to do the night is fine the walrus said do you admire the view </s>
<s> it was so kind of you to come </s>
<s> and you are very nice the carpenter said nothing but cut us another slice wish you were not quite so deaf i've had to ask you twice it seems shame the walrus said to play them such trick after we've brought them out so far and made them trot so quick the carpenter said nothing but the butter's spread too thick weep for you the walrus said </s>
<s> deeply sympathize with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size </s>
<s> holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes </s>
<s> oysters said the carpenter </s>
<s> you've had pleasant run </s>
<s> shall we be trotting home again but answer came there none and that was scarcely odd because they'd eaten every one like the walrus best said alice because you see he was little sorry for the poor oysters he ate more than the carpenter though said tweedledee </s>
<s> you see he held his handkerchief in front so that the carpenter couldn't count how many he took contrariwise that was mean alice said indignantly </s>
<s> then like the carpenter best if he didn't eat so many as the walrus but he ate as many as he could get said tweedledum </s>
<s> this was puzzler </s>
<s> after pause alice began well </s>
<s> they were both very unpleasant characters here she checked herself in some alarm at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of large steam engine in the wood near them though she feared it was more likely to be wild beast </s>
<s> are there any lions or tigers about here she asked timidly </s>
<s> it's only the red king snoring said tweedledee </s>
<s> come and look at him the brothers cried and they each took one of alice's hands and led her up to where the king was sleeping </s>
<s> isn't he lovely sight said tweedledum </s>
<s> alice couldn't say honestly that he was </s>
<s> he had tall red night cap on with tassel and he was lying crumpled up into sort of untidy heap and snoring loud fit to snore his head off as tweedledum remarked </s>
<s> i'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass said alice who was very thoughtful little girl </s>
<s> he's dreaming now said tweedledee and what do you think he's dreaming about alice said nobody can guess that why about you tweedledee exclaimed clapping his hands triumphantly </s>
<s> and if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose you'd be where am now of course said alice </s>
<s> not you tweedledee retorted contemptuously </s>
<s> you'd be nowhere </s>
<s> why you're only sort of thing in his dream if that there king was to wake added tweedledum you'd go out bang just like candle shouldn't alice exclaimed indignantly </s>
<s> besides if i'm only sort of thing in his dream what are you should like to know ditto said tweedledum </s>
<s> ditto ditto cried tweedledee </s>
<s> he shouted this so loud that alice couldn't help saying hush </s>
<s> you'll be waking him i'm afraid if you make so much noise well it no use your talking about waking him said tweedledum when you're only one of the things in his dream </s>
<s> you know very well you're not real am real said alice and began to cry </s>
<s> you won't make yourself bit realler by crying tweedledee remarked there's nothing to cry about if wasn't real alice said half laughing through her tears it all seemed so ridiculous shouldn't be able to cry hope you don't suppose those are real tears tweedledum interrupted in tone of great contempt </s>
<s> know they're talking nonsense alice thought to herself and it's foolish to cry about it so she brushed away her tears and went on as cheerfully as she could </s>
<s> at any rate i'd better be getting out of the wood for really it's coming on very dark </s>
<s> do you think it's going to rain tweedledum spread large umbrella over himself and his brother and looked up into it </s>
<s> no don't think it is he said at least not under here </s>
<s> nohow but it may rain outside it may if it chooses said tweedledee we've no objection </s>
<s> contrariwise selfish things thought alice and she was just going to say good night and leave them when tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist </s>
<s> do you see that he said in voice choking with passion and his eyes grew large and yellow all in moment as he pointed with trembling finger at small white thing lying under the tree </s>
<s> it's only rattle alice said after careful examination of the little white thing </s>
<s> not rattlesnake you know she added hastily thinking that he was frightened only an old rattle quite old and broken knew it was cried tweedledum beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair </s>
<s> it's spoilt of course here he looked at tweedledee who immediately sat down on the ground and tried to hide himself under the umbrella </s>
<s> alice laid her hand upon his arm and said in soothing tone you needn't be so angry about an old rattle but it isn't old tweedledum cried in greater fury than ever </s>
<s> it's new tell you bought it yesterday my nice new rattle and his voice rose to perfect scream </s>
<s> all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella with himself in it which was such an extraordinary thing to do that it quite took off alice's attention from the angry brother </s>
<s> but he couldn't quite succeed and it ended in his rolling over bundled up in the umbrella with only his head out and there he lay opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyes looking more like fish than anything else alice thought </s>
<s> of course you agree to have battle tweedledum said in calmer tone </s>
<s> suppose so the other sulkily replied as he crawled out of the umbrella only she must help us to dress up you know so the two brothers went off hand in hand into the wood and returned in minute with their arms full of things such as bolsters blankets hearth rugs table cloths dish covers and coal scuttles </s>
<s> hope you're good hand at pinning and tying strings tweedledum remarked </s>
<s> every one of these things has got to go on somehow or other alice said afterwards she had never seen such fuss made about anything in all her life the way those two bustled about and the quantity of things they put on and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttons really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else by the time they're ready she said to herself as she arranged bolster round the neck of tweedledee to keep his head from being cut off as he said </s>
<s> you know he added very gravely it's one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in battle to get one's head cut off alice laughed aloud but she managed to turn it into cough for fear of hurting his feelings </s>
<s> do look very pale said tweedledum coming up to have his helmet tied on </s>
<s> he called it helmet though it certainly looked much more like saucepan well yes little alice replied gently </s>
<s> i'm very brave generally he went on in low voice only to day happen to have headache and i've got toothache said tweedledee who had overheard the remark </s>
<s> i'm far worse off than you then you'd better not fight to day said alice thinking it good opportunity to make peace </s>
<s> we must have bit of fight but don't care about going on long said tweedledum </s>
<s> what's the time now tweedledee looked at his watch and said half past four let's fight till six and then have dinner said tweedledum </s>
<s> very well the other said rather sadly and she can watch us only you'd better not come very close he added generally hit everything can see when get really excited and hit everything within reach cried tweedledum whether can see it or not alice laughed </s>
<s> you must hit the trees pretty often should think she said </s>
<s> tweedledum looked round him with satisfied smile </s>
<s> don't suppose he said there'll be tree left standing for ever so far round by the time we've finished and all about rattle said alice still hoping to make them little ashamed of fighting for such trifle </s>
<s> shouldn't have minded it so much said tweedledum if it hadn't been new one wish the monstrous crow would come thought alice </s>
<s> there's only one sword you know tweedledum said to his brother but you can have the umbrella it's quite as sharp </s>
<s> only we must begin quick </s>
<s> it's getting as dark as it can and darker said tweedledee </s>
<s> it was getting dark so suddenly that alice thought there must be thunderstorm coming on </s>
<s> what thick black cloud that is she said </s>
<s> and how fast it comes </s>
<s> why do believe it's got wings it's the crow tweedledum cried out in shrill voice of alarm and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in moment </s>
<s> alice ran little way into the wood and stopped under large tree </s>
<s> it can never get at me here she thought it's far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees </s>
<s> but wish it wouldn't flap its wings so it makes quite hurricane in the wood here's somebody's shawl being blown away chapter </s>
<s> wool and water she caught the shawl as she spoke and looked about for the owner in another moment the white queen came running wildly through the wood with both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying and alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl </s>
<s> i'm very glad happened to be in the way alice said as she helped her to put on her shawl again </s>
<s> the white queen only looked at her in helpless frightened sort of way and kept repeating something in whisper to herself that sounded like bread and butter bread and butter and alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all she must manage it herself </s>
<s> so she began rather timidly am addressing the white queen well yes if you call that dressing the queen said </s>
<s> it isn't my notion of the thing at all alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation so she smiled and said if your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin i'll do it as well as can but don't want it done at all groaned the poor queen </s>
<s> i've been dressing myself for the last two hours it would have been all the better as it seemed to alice if she had got some one else to dress her she was so dreadfully untidy </s>
<s> every single thing's crooked alice thought to herself and she's all over pins may put your shawl straight for you she added aloud </s>
<s> don't know what's the matter with it the queen said in melancholy voice </s>
<s> it's out of temper think </s>
<s> i've pinned it here and i've pinned it there but there's no pleasing it it can't go straight you know if you pin it all on one side alice said as she gently put it right for her and dear me what state your hair is in the brush has got entangled in it the queen said with sigh </s>
<s> and lost the comb yesterday alice carefully released the brush and did her best to get the hair into order </s>
<s> come you look rather better now she said after altering most of the pins </s>
<s> but really you should have lady's maid i'm sure i'll take you with pleasure the queen said </s>
<s> twopence week and jam every other day alice couldn't help laughing as she said don't want you to hire me and don't care for jam it's very good jam said the queen </s>
<s> well don't want any to day at any rate you couldn't have it if you did want it the queen said </s>
<s> the rule is jam to morrow and jam yesterday but never jam to day it must come sometimes to jam to day alice objected </s>
<s> no it can't said the queen </s>
<s> it's jam every other day to day isn't any other day you know don't understand you said alice </s>
<s> it's dreadfully confusing that's the effect of living backwards the queen said kindly it always makes one little giddy at first living backwards alice repeated in great astonishment </s>
<s> never heard of such thing but there's one great advantage in it that one's memory works both ways i'm sure mine only works one way alice remarked </s>
<s> can't remember things before they happen it's poor sort of memory that only works backwards the queen remarked </s>
<s> what sort of things do you remember best alice ventured to ask </s>
<s> oh things that happened the week after next the queen replied in careless tone </s>
<s> for instance now she went on sticking large piece of plaster band aid on her finger as she spoke there's the king's messenger </s>
<s> he's in prison now being punished and the trial doesn't even begin till next wednesday and of course the crime comes last of all suppose he never commits the crime said alice </s>
<s> that would be all the better wouldn't it the queen said as she bound the plaster round her finger with bit of ribbon </s>
<s> alice felt there was no denying that </s>
<s> of course it would be all the better she said but it wouldn't be all the better his being punished you're wrong there at any rate said the queen were you ever punished only for faults said alice </s>
<s> and you were all the better for it know the queen said triumphantly </s>
<s> yes but then had done the things was punished for said alice that makes all the difference but if you hadn't done them the queen said that would have been better still better and better and better her voice went higher with each better till it got quite to squeak at last </s>
<s> alice was just beginning to say there's mistake somewhere when the queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished </s>
<s> oh oh oh shouted the queen shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off </s>
<s> my finger's bleeding </s>
<s> oh oh oh oh her screams were so exactly like the whistle of steam engine that alice had to hold both her hands over her ears </s>
<s> what is the matter she said as soon as there was chance of making herself heard </s>
<s> have you pricked your finger haven't pricked it yet the queen said but soon shall oh oh oh when do you expect to do it alice asked feeling very much inclined to laugh </s>
<s> when fasten my shawl again the poor queen groaned out the brooch will come undone directly </s>
<s> oh oh as she said the words the brooch flew open and the queen clutched wildly at it and tried to clasp it again </s>
<s> take care cried alice </s>
<s> you're holding it all crooked and she caught at the brooch but it was too late the pin had slipped and the queen had pricked her finger </s>
<s> that accounts for the bleeding you see she said to alice with smile </s>
<s> now you understand the way things happen here but why don't you scream now alice asked holding her hands ready to put over her ears again </s>
<s> why i've done all the screaming already said the queen </s>
<s> what would be the good of having it all over again by this time it was getting light </s>
<s> the crow must have flown away think said alice i'm so glad it's gone </s>
<s> thought it was the night coming on wish could manage to be glad the queen said </s>
<s> only never can remember the rule </s>
<s> you must be very happy living in this wood and being glad whenever you like only it is so very lonely here alice said in melancholy voice and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks </s>
<s> oh don't go on like that cried the poor queen wringing her hands in despair </s>
<s> consider what great girl you are </s>
<s> consider what long way you've come to day </s>
<s> consider what o'clock it is </s>
<s> consider anything only don't cry alice could not help laughing at this even in the midst of her tears </s>
<s> can you keep from crying by considering things she asked </s>
<s> that's the way it's done the queen said with great decision nobody can do two things at once you know </s>
<s> let's consider your age to begin with how old are you i'm seven and half exactly you needn't say exactually the queen remarked can believe it without that </s>
<s> now i'll give you something to believe </s>
<s> i'm just one hundred and one five months and day can't believe that said alice </s>
<s> can't you the queen said in pitying tone </s>
<s> try again draw long breath and shut your eyes alice laughed </s>
<s> there's no use trying she said one can't believe impossible things daresay you haven't had much practice said the queen </s>
<s> when was your age always did it for half an hour day </s>
<s> why sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast </s>
<s> there goes the shawl again the brooch had come undone as she spoke and sudden gust of wind blew the queen's shawl across little brook </s>
<s> the queen spread out her arms again and went flying after it and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself </s>
<s> i've got it she cried in triumphant tone </s>
<s> now you shall see me pin it on again all by myself then hope your finger is better now alice said very politely as she crossed the little brook after the queen </s>
<s> oh much better cried the queen her voice rising to squeak as she went on </s>
<s> much be etter </s>
<s> be etter </s>
<s> be etter </s>
<s> be ehh the last word ended in long bleat so like sheep that alice quite started </s>
<s> she looked at the queen who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool </s>
<s> alice rubbed her eyes and looked again </s>
<s> she couldn't make out what had happened at all </s>
<s> was she in shop </s>
<s> and was that really was it really sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter </s>
<s> rub as she could she could make nothing more of it she was in little dark shop leaning with her elbows on the counter and opposite to her was an old sheep sitting in an arm chair knitting and every now and then leaving off to look at her through great pair of spectacles </s>
<s> what is it you want to buy the sheep said at last looking up for moment from her knitting </s>
<s> don't quite know yet alice said very gently </s>
<s> should like to look all round me first if might you may look in front of you and on both sides if you like said the sheep but you can't look all round you unless you've got eyes at the back of your head but these as it happened alice had not got so she contented herself with turning round looking at the shelves as she came to them </s>
<s> the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things but the oddest part of it all was that whenever she looked hard at any shelf to make out exactly what it had on it that particular shelf was always quite empty though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold </s>
<s> things flow about so here she said at last in plaintive tone after she had spent minute or so in vainly pursuing large bright thing that looked sometimes like doll and sometimes like work box and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at </s>
<s> and this one is the most provoking of all but i'll tell you what she added as sudden thought struck her i'll follow it up to the very top shelf of all </s>
<s> it'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling expect but even this plan failed the thing went through the ceiling as quietly as possible as if it were quite used to it </s>
<s> are you child or teetotum the sheep said as she took up another pair of needles </s>
<s> you'll make me giddy soon if you go on turning round like that she was now working with fourteen pairs at once and alice couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment </s>
<s> how can she knit with so many the puzzled child thought to herself </s>
<s> she gets more and more like porcupine every minute can you row the sheep asked handing her pair of knitting needles as she spoke </s>
<s> yes little but not on land and not with needles alice was beginning to say when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands and she found they were in little boat gliding along between banks so there was nothing for it but to do her best </s>
<s> feather cried the sheep as she took up another pair of needles </s>
<s> this didn't sound like remark that needed any answer so alice said nothing but pulled away </s>
<s> there was something very queer about the water she thought as every now and then the oars got fast in it and would hardly come out again </s>
<s> feather </s>
<s> feather the sheep cried again taking more needles </s>
<s> you'll be catching crab directly dear little crab thought alice </s>
<s> should like that didn't you hear me say feather the sheep cried angrily taking up quite bunch of needles </s>
<s> indeed did said alice you've said it very often and very loud </s>
<s> please where are the crabs in the water of course said the sheep sticking some of the needles into her hair as her hands were full </s>
<s> feather say why do you say feather so often alice asked at last rather vexed </s>
<s> i'm not bird you are said the sheep you're little goose this offended alice little so there was no more conversation for minute or two while the boat glided gently on sometimes among beds of weeds which made the oars stick fast in the water worse then ever and sometimes under trees but always with the same tall river banks frowning over their heads </s>
<s> oh please </s>
<s> there are some scented rushes alice cried in sudden transport of delight </s>
<s> there really are and such beauties you needn't say please to me about em the sheep said without looking up from her knitting didn't put em there and i'm not going to take em away no but meant please may we wait and pick some alice pleaded </s>
<s> if you don't mind stopping the boat for minute how am to stop it said the sheep </s>
<s> if you leave off rowing it'll stop of itself so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would till it glided gently in among the waving rushes </s>
<s> and then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up and the little arms were plunged in elbow deep to get the rushes good long way down before breaking them off and for while alice forgot all about the sheep and the knitting as she bent over the side of the boat with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes </s>
<s> only hope the boat won't tipple over she said to herself </s>
<s> oh what lovely one </s>
<s> only couldn't quite reach it and it certainly did seem little provoking almost as if it happened on purpose she thought that though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by there was always more lovely one that she couldn't reach </s>
<s> the prettiest are always further she said at last with sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off as with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands she scrambled back into her place and began to arrange her new found treasures </s>
<s> what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade and to lose all their scent and beauty from the very moment that she picked them </s>
<s> even real scented rushes you know last only very little while and these being dream rushes melted away almost like snow as they lay in heaps at her feet but alice hardly noticed this there were so many other curious things to think about </s>
<s> they hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and wouldn't come out again so alice explained it afterwards and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin and in spite of series of little shrieks of oh oh oh from poor alice it swept her straight off the seat and down among the heap of rushes </s>
<s> however she wasn't hurt and was soon up again the sheep went on with her knitting all the while just as if nothing had happened </s>
<s> that was nice crab you caught she remarked as alice got back into her place very much relieved to find herself still in the boat </s>
<s> was it </s>
<s> didn't see it said alice peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water </s>
<s> wish it hadn't let go should so like to see little crab to take home with me but the sheep only laughed scornfully and went on with her knitting </s>
<s> are there many crabs here said alice </s>
<s> crabs and all sorts of things said the sheep plenty of choice only make up your mind </s>
<s> now what do you want to buy to buy alice echoed in tone that was half astonished and half frightened for the oars and the boat and the river had vanished all in moment and she was back again in the little dark shop </s>
<s> should like to buy an egg please she said timidly </s>
<s> how do you sell them fivepence farthing for one twopence for two the sheep replied </s>
<s> then two are cheaper than one alice said in surprised tone taking out her purse </s>
<s> only you must eat them both if you buy two said the sheep </s>
<s> then i'll have one please said alice as she put the money down on the counter </s>
<s> for she thought to herself they mightn't be at all nice you know the sheep took the money and put it away in box then she said never put things into people's hands that would never do you must get it for yourself and so saying she went off to the other end of the shop and set the egg upright on shelf </s>
<s> wonder why it wouldn't do thought alice as she groped her way among the tables and chairs for the shop was very dark towards the end </s>
<s> the egg seems to get further away the more walk towards it </s>
<s> let me see is this chair </s>
<s> why it's got branches declare </s>
<s> how very odd to find trees growing here </s>
<s> and actually here's little brook </s>
<s> well this is the very queerest shop ever saw so she went on wondering more and more at every step as everything turned into tree the moment she came up to it and she quite expected the egg to do the same </s>
<s> chapter vi </s>
<s> humpty dumpty however the egg only got larger and larger and more and more human when she had come within few yards of it she saw that it had eyes and nose and mouth and when she had come close to it she saw clearly that it was humpty dumpty himself </s>
<s> it can't be anybody else she said to herself </s>
<s> i'm as certain of it as if his name were written all over his face it might have been written hundred times easily on that enormous face </s>
<s> humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed like turk on the top of high wall such narrow one that alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance and as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction and he didn't take the least notice of her she thought he must be stuffed figure after all </s>

<s> that wall is so very narrow what tremendously easy riddles you ask humpty dumpty growled out </s>
<s> of course don't think so </s>
<s> why if ever did fall off which there's no chance of but if did here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn and grand that alice could hardly help laughing </s>

<s> i'm one that has spoken to king am mayhap you'll never see such another and to show you i'm not proud you may shake hands with me and he grinned almost from ear to ear as he leant forwards and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so and offered alice his hand </s>

<s> in that case we start fresh said humpty dumpty and it's my turn to choose subject he talks about it just as if it was game thought alice so here's question for you </s>
<s> how old did you say you were alice made short calculation and said seven years and six months wrong humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly </s>
<s> you never said word like it though you meant how old are you alice explained </s>
<s> if i'd meant that i'd have said it said humpty dumpty </s>
<s> alice didn't want to begin another argument so she said nothing </s>

<s> with proper assistance you might have left off at seven what beautiful belt you've got on alice suddenly remarked </s>
<s> they had had quite enough of the subject of age she thought and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects it was her turn now at least she corrected herself on second thoughts beautiful cravat should have said no belt mean beg your pardon she added in dismay for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended and she began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject </s>

<s> it's cravat child and beautiful one as you say </s>
<s> it's present from the white king and queen </s>
<s> there now is it really said alice quite pleased to find that she had chosen good subject after all </s>
<s> they gave it me humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it they gave it me for an un birthday present beg your pardon alice said with puzzled air </s>
<s> i'm not offended said humpty dumpty </s>

<s> like birthday presents best she said at last </s>
<s> you don't know what you're talking about cried humpty dumpty </s>
<s> how many days are there in year three hundred and sixty five said alice </s>
<s> and how many birthdays have you one and if you take one from three hundred and sixty five what remains three hundred and sixty four of course humpty dumpty looked doubtful </s>
<s> i'd rather see that done on paper he said </s>
<s> alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum book and worked the sum for him humpty dumpty took the book and looked at it carefully </s>
<s> that seems to be done right he began </s>
<s> you're holding it upside down alice interrupted </s>
<s> to be sure was humpty dumpty said gaily as she turned it round for him </s>
<s> thought it looked little queer </s>
<s> as was saying that seems to be done right though haven't time to look it over thoroughly just now and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty four days when you might get un birthday presents certainly said alice </s>

<s> of course you don't till tell you </s>
<s> meant there's nice knock down argument for you but glory doesn't mean nice knock down argument alice objected </s>
<s> when use word humpty dumpty said in rather scornful tone it means just what choose it to mean neither more nor less the question is said alice whether you can make words mean so many different things the question is said humpty dumpty which is to be master that's all alice was too much puzzled to say anything so after minute humpty dumpty began again </s>

<s> impenetrability </s>
<s> that's what say would you tell me please said alice what that means now you talk like reasonable child said humpty dumpty looking very much pleased </s>
<s> meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of that subject and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next as suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life that's great deal to make one word mean alice said in thoughtful tone </s>

<s> she was too much puzzled to make any other remark </s>
<s> ah you should see em come round me of saturday night humpty dumpty went on wagging his head gravely from side to side for to get their wages you know alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with and so you see can't tell you you seem very clever at explaining words sir said alice </s>
<s> would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called jabberwocky let's hear it said humpty dumpty </s>
<s> can explain all the poems that were ever invented and good many that haven't been invented just yet this sounded very hopeful so alice repeated the first verse twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe </s>
<s> that's enough to begin with humpty dumpty interrupted there are plenty of hard words there </s>
<s> brillig means four o'clock in the afternoon the time when you begin broiling things for dinner that'll do very well said alice and slithy well slithy means lithe and slimy lithe is the same as active you see it's like portmanteau there are two meanings packed up into one word see it now alice remarked thoughtfully and what are toves well toves are something like badgers they're something like lizards and they're something like corkscrews they must be very curious looking creatures they are that said humpty dumpty also they make their nests under sun dials also they live on cheese and what's the gyre and to gimble to gyre is to go round and round like gyroscope </s>
<s> to gimble is to make holes like gimlet and the wabe is the grass plot round sun dial suppose said alice surprised at her own ingenuity </s>
<s> of course it is </s>
<s> it's called wabe you know because it goes long way before it and long way behind it and long way beyond it on each side alice added </s>
<s> exactly so </s>
<s> well then mimsy is flimsy and miserable there's another portmanteau for you </s>
<s> and borogove is thin shabby looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round something like live mop and then mome raths said alice </s>
<s> i'm afraid i'm giving you great deal of trouble well rath is sort of green pig but mome i'm not certain about </s>
<s> think it's short for from home meaning that they'd lost their way you know and what does outgrabe mean well outgrabing is something between bellowing and whistling with kind of sneeze in the middle however you'll hear it done maybe down in the wood yonder and when you've once heard it you'll be quite content </s>
<s> who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you read it in book said alice </s>
<s> but had some poetry repeated to me much easier than that by tweedledee think it was as to poetry you know said humpty dumpty stretching out one of his great hands can repeat poetry as well as other folk if it comes to that oh it needn't come to that alice hastily said hoping to keep him from beginning </s>
<s> the piece i'm going to repeat he went on without noticing her remark was written entirely for your amusement alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it so she sat down and said thank you rather sadly </s>

<s> that's all said humpty dumpty </s>
<s> good bye this was rather sudden alice thought but after such very strong hint that she ought to be going she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay </s>
<s> so she got up and held out her hand </s>
<s> good bye till we meet again she said as cheerfully as she could </s>
<s> shouldn't know you again if we did meet humpty dumpty replied in discontented tone giving her one of his fingers to shake you're so exactly like other people the face is what one goes by generally alice remarked in thoughtful tone </s>

<s> but humpty dumpty only shut his eyes and said wait till you've tried alice waited minute to see if he would speak again but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her she said good bye once more and getting no answer to this she quietly walked away but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went of all the unsatisfactory she repeated this aloud as it was great comfort to have such long word to say of all the unsatisfactory people ever met she never finished the sentence for at this moment heavy crash shook the forest from end to end </s>

<s> then came the horses </s>
<s> having four feet these managed rather better than the foot soldiers but even they stumbled now and then and it seemed to be regular rule that whenever horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly </s>
<s> the confusion got worse every moment and alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place where she found the white king seated on the ground busily writing in his memorandum book </s>
<s> i've sent them all the king cried in tone of delight on seeing alice </s>
<s> did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as you came through the wood yes did said alice several thousand should think four thousand two hundred and seven that's the exact number the king said referring to his book </s>
<s> couldn't send all the horses you know because two of them are wanted in the game </s>
<s> and haven't sent the two messengers either </s>
<s> they're both gone to the town </s>

<s> only wish had such eyes the king remarked in fretful tone </s>
<s> to be able to see nobody </s>
<s> and at that distance too </s>
<s> why it's as much as can do to see real people by this light all this was lost on alice who was still looking intently along the road shading her eyes with one hand </s>

<s> but he's coming very slowly and what curious attitudes he goes into for the messenger kept skipping up and down and wriggling like an eel as he came along with his great hands spread out like fans on each side not at all said the king </s>

<s> why one to come and one to go didn't tell you the king repeated impatiently </s>
<s> must have two to fetch and carry </s>
<s> one to fetch and one to carry at this moment the messenger arrived he was far too much out of breath to say word and could only wave his hands about and make the most fearful faces at the poor king </s>
<s> this young lady loves you with an the king said introducing alice in the hope of turning off the messenger's attention from himself but it was no use the anglo saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side </s>
<s> you alarm me said the king </s>
<s> feel faint give me ham sandwich on which the messenger to alice's great amusement opened bag that hung round his neck and handed sandwich to the king who devoured it greedily </s>
<s> another sandwich said the king </s>
<s> there's nothing but hay left now the messenger said peeping into the bag </s>
<s> hay then the king murmured in faint whisper </s>
<s> alice was glad to see that it revived him good deal </s>
<s> there's nothing like eating hay when you're faint he remarked to her as he munched away </s>
<s> should think throwing cold water over you would be better alice suggested or some sal volatile didn't say there was nothing better the king replied </s>
<s> said there was nothing like it which alice did not venture to deny </s>
<s> who did you pass on the road the king went on holding out his hand to the messenger for some more hay </s>
<s> nobody said the messenger </s>
<s> quite right said the king this young lady saw him too </s>
<s> so of course nobody walks slower than you do my best the messenger said in sulky tone </s>
<s> i'm sure nobody walks much faster than do he can't do that said the king or else he'd have been here first </s>
<s> however now you've got your breath you may tell us what's happened in the town i'll whisper it said the messenger putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of trumpet and stooping so as to get close to the king's ear </s>
<s> alice was sorry for this as she wanted to hear the news too </s>
<s> however instead of whispering he simply shouted at the top of his voice they're at it again do you call that whisper cried the poor king jumping up and shaking himself </s>
<s> if you do such thing again i'll have you buttered </s>
<s> it went through and through my head like an earthquake it would have to be very tiny earthquake thought alice </s>
<s> who are at it again she ventured to ask </s>
<s> why the lion and the unicorn of course said the king </s>
<s> fighting for the crown yes to be sure said the king and the best of the joke is that it's my crown all the while </s>
<s> let's run and see them and they trotted off alice repeating to herself as she ran the words of the old song the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown the lion beat the unicorn all round the town </s>
<s> some gave them white bread some gave them brown some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town does the one that wins get the crown she asked as well as she could for the run was putting her quite out of breath </s>
<s> dear me no said the king </s>
<s> what an idea would you be good enough alice panted out after running little further to stop minute just to get one's breath again i'm good enough the king said only i'm not strong enough </s>
<s> you see minute goes by so fearfully quick </s>
<s> you might as well try to stop bandersnatch alice had no more breath for talking so they trotted on in silence till they came in sight of great crowd in the middle of which the lion and unicorn were fighting </s>
<s> they were in such cloud of dust that at first alice could not make out which was which but she soon managed to distinguish the unicorn by his horn </s>
<s> they placed themselves close to where hatta the other messenger was standing watching the fight with cup of tea in one hand and piece of bread and butter in the other </s>
<s> he's only just out of prison and he hadn't finished his tea when he was sent in haigha whispered to alice and they only give them oyster shells in there so you see he's very hungry and thirsty </s>
<s> how are you dear child he went on putting his arm affectionately round hatta's neck </s>
<s> hatta looked round and nodded and went on with his bread and butter </s>
<s> were you happy in prison dear child said haigha </s>
<s> hatta looked round once more and this time tear or two trickled down his cheek but not word would he say </s>
<s> speak can't you haigha cried impatiently </s>
<s> but hatta only munched away and drank some more tea </s>
<s> speak won't you cried the king </s>
<s> how are they getting on with the fight hatta made desperate effort and swallowed large piece of bread and butter </s>
<s> they're getting on very well he said in choking voice each of them has been down about eighty seven times then suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown alice ventured to remark </s>
<s> it's waiting for em now said hatta this is bit of it as i'm eating there was pause in the fight just then and the lion and the unicorn sat down panting while the king called out ten minutes allowed for refreshments haigha and hatta set to work at once carrying rough trays of white and brown bread </s>
<s> alice took piece to taste but it was very dry </s>
<s> don't think they'll fight any more to day the king said to hatta go and order the drums to begin and hatta went bounding away like grasshopper </s>
<s> for minute or two alice stood silent watching him </s>
<s> suddenly she brightened up </s>
<s> look look she cried pointing eagerly </s>
<s> there's the white queen running across the country </s>
<s> she came flying out of the wood over yonder how fast those queens can run there's some enemy after her no doubt the king said without even looking round </s>
<s> that wood's full of them but aren't you going to run and help her alice asked very much surprised at his taking it so quietly </s>
<s> no use no use said the king </s>
<s> she runs so fearfully quick </s>
<s> you might as well try to catch bandersnatch </s>
<s> but i'll make memorandum about her if you like she's dear good creature he repeated softly to himself as he opened his memorandum book </s>
<s> do you spell creature with double at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them with his hands in his pockets </s>
<s> had the best of it this time he said to the king just glancing at him as he passed </s>
<s> little little the king replied rather nervously </s>
<s> you shouldn't have run him through with your horn you know it didn't hurt him the unicorn said carelessly and he was going on when his eye happened to fall upon alice he turned round rather instantly and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust </s>
<s> what is this he said at last </s>
<s> this is child haigha replied eagerly coming in front of alice to introduce her and spreading out both his hands towards her in an anglo saxon attitude </s>
<s> we only found it to day </s>
<s> it's as large as life and twice as natural always thought they were fabulous monsters said the unicorn </s>
<s> is it alive it can talk said haigha solemnly </s>
<s> the unicorn looked dreamily at alice and said talk child alice could not help her lips curling up into smile as she began do you know always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters too </s>
<s> never saw one alive before well now that we have seen each other said the unicorn if you'll believe in me i'll believe in you </s>
<s> is that bargain yes if you like said alice </s>
<s> come fetch out the plum cake old man the unicorn went on turning from her to the king </s>
<s> none of your brown bread for me certainly certainly the king muttered and beckoned to haigha </s>
<s> open the bag he whispered </s>
<s> quick </s>
<s> not that one that's full of hay haigha took large cake out of the bag and gave it to alice to hold while he got out dish and carving knife </s>
<s> how they all came out of it alice couldn't guess </s>
<s> it was just like conjuring trick she thought </s>
<s> the lion had joined them while this was going on he looked very tired and sleepy and his eyes were half shut </s>
<s> what's this he said blinking lazily at alice and speaking in deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of great bell </s>
<s> ah what is it now the unicorn cried eagerly </s>
<s> you'll never guess </s>
<s> couldn't the lion looked at alice wearily </s>
<s> are you animal vegetable or mineral he said yawning at every other word </s>
<s> it's fabulous monster the unicorn cried out before alice could reply </s>
<s> then hand round the plum cake monster the lion said lying down and putting his chin on this paws </s>
<s> and sit down both of you to the king and the unicorn fair play with the cake you know the king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures but there was no other place for him </s>
<s> what fight we might have for the crown now the unicorn said looking slyly up at the crown which the poor king was nearly shaking off his head he trembled so much </s>
<s> should win easy said the lion </s>
<s> i'm not so sure of that said the unicorn </s>
<s> why beat you all round the town you chicken the lion replied angrily half getting up as he spoke </s>
<s> here the king interrupted to prevent the quarrel going on he was very nervous and his voice quite quivered </s>
<s> all round the town he said </s>
<s> that's good long way </s>
<s> did you go by the old bridge or the market place </s>
<s> you get the best view by the old bridge i'm sure don't know the lion growled out as he lay down again </s>
<s> there was too much dust to see anything </s>
<s> what time the monster is cutting up that cake alice had seated herself on the bank of little brook with the great dish on her knees and was sawing away diligently with the knife </s>
<s> it's very provoking she said in reply to the lion she was getting quite used to being called the monster </s>
<s> i've cut several slices already but they always join on again you don't know how to manage looking glass cakes the unicorn remarked </s>
<s> hand it round first and cut it afterwards this sounded nonsense but alice very obediently got up and carried the dish round and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so </s>
<s> now cut it up said the lion as she returned to her place with the empty dish </s>
<s> say this isn't fair cried the unicorn as alice sat with the knife in her hand very much puzzled how to begin </s>
<s> the monster has given the lion twice as much as me she's kept none for herself anyhow said the lion </s>
<s> do you like plum cake monster but before alice could answer him the drums began </s>
<s> where the noise came from she couldn't make out the air seemed full of it and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened </s>
<s> she started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast before she dropped to her knees and put her hands over her ears vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar </s>
<s> if that doesn't drum them out of town she thought to herself nothing ever will chapter viii </s>
<s> it's my own invention after while the noise seemed gradually to die away till all was dead silence and alice lifted up her head in some alarm </s>
<s> there was no one to be seen and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo saxon messengers </s>
<s> however there was the great dish still lying at her feet on which she had tried to cut the plum cake so wasn't dreaming after all she said to herself unless unless we're all part of the same dream </s>
<s> only do hope it's my dream and not the red king's </s>
<s> don't like belonging to another person's dream she went on in rather complaining tone i've great mind to go and wake him and see what happens at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by loud shouting of ahoy </s>
<s> ahoy </s>
<s> check and knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her brandishing great club </s>
<s> just as he reached her the horse stopped suddenly you're my prisoner the knight cried as he tumbled off his horse </s>
<s> startled as she was alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again </s>
<s> as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle he began once more you're my but here another voice broke in ahoy </s>
<s> ahoy </s>
<s> check and alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy </s>
<s> this time it was white knight </s>
<s> he drew up at alice's side and tumbled off his horse just as the red knight had done then he got on again and the two knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking </s>
<s> alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment </s>
<s> she's my prisoner you know the red knight said at last </s>
<s> yes but then came and rescued her the white knight replied </s>
<s> well we must fight for her then said the red knight as he took up his helmet which hung from the saddle and was something the shape of horse's head and put it on </s>
<s> you will observe the rules of battle of course the white knight remarked putting on his helmet too </s>
<s> always do said the red knight and they began banging away at each other with such fury that alice got behind tree to be out of the way of the blows </s>
<s> wonder now what the rules of battle are she said to herself as she watched the fight timidly peeping out from her hiding place one rule seems to be that if one knight hits the other he knocks him off his horse and if he misses he tumbles off himself and another rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms as if they were punch and judy what noise they make when they tumble </s>
<s> just like whole set of fire irons falling into the fender </s>
<s> and how quiet the horses are </s>
<s> they let them get on and off them just as if they were tables another rule of battle that alice had not noticed seemed to be that they always fell on their heads and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way side by side when they got up again they shook hands and then the red knight mounted and galloped off </s>
<s> it was glorious victory wasn't it said the white knight as he came up panting </s>
<s> don't know alice said doubtfully </s>
<s> don't want to be anybody's prisoner </s>
<s> want to be queen so you will when you've crossed the next brook said the white knight </s>
<s> i'll see you safe to the end of the wood and then must go back you know </s>
<s> that's the end of my move thank you very much said alice </s>
<s> may help you off with your helmet it was evidently more than he could manage by himself however she managed to shake him out of it at last </s>
<s> now one can breathe more easily said the knight putting back his shaggy hair with both hands and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to alice </s>
<s> she thought she had never seen such strange looking soldier in all her life </s>
<s> he was dressed in tin armour which seemed to fit him very badly and he had queer shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder upside down and with the lid hanging open </s>
<s> alice looked at it with great curiosity </s>
<s> see you're admiring my little box the knight said in friendly tone </s>
<s> it's my own invention to keep clothes and sandwiches in </s>
<s> you see carry it upside down so that the rain can't get in but the things can get out alice gently remarked </s>
<s> do you know the lid's open didn't know it the knight said shade of vexation passing over his face </s>
<s> then all the things must have fallen out </s>
<s> and the box is no use without them he unfastened it as he spoke and was just going to throw it into the bushes when sudden thought seemed to strike him and he hung it carefully on tree </s>
<s> can you guess why did that he said to alice </s>
<s> alice shook her head </s>
<s> in hopes some bees may make nest in it then should get the honey but you've got bee hive or something like one fastened to the saddle said alice </s>
<s> yes it's very good bee hive the knight said in discontented tone one of the best kind </s>
<s> but not single bee has come near it yet </s>
<s> and the other thing is mouse trap </s>
<s> suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out don't know which was wondering what the mouse trap was for said alice </s>
<s> it isn't very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back not very likely perhaps said the knight but if they do come don't choose to have them running all about you see he went on after pause it's as well to be provided for everything </s>
<s> that's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet but what are they for alice asked in tone of great curiosity </s>
<s> to guard against the bites of sharks the knight replied </s>
<s> it's an invention of my own </s>
<s> and now help me on </s>
<s> i'll go with you to the end of the wood what's the dish for it's meant for plum cake said alice </s>
<s> we'd better take it with us the knight said </s>
<s> it'll come in handy if we find any plum cake </s>
<s> help me to get it into this bag this took very long time to manage though alice held the bag open very carefully because the knight was so very awkward in putting in the dish the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead </s>
<s> it's rather tight fit you see he said as they got it in last there are so many candlesticks in the bag and he hung it to the saddle which was already loaded with bunches of carrots and fire irons and many other things </s>
<s> hope you've got your hair well fastened on he continued as they set off </s>
<s> only in the usual way alice said smiling </s>
<s> that's hardly enough he said anxiously </s>
<s> you see the wind is so very strong here </s>
<s> it's as strong as soup have you invented plan for keeping the hair from being blown off alice enquired </s>
<s> not yet said the knight </s>
<s> but i've got plan for keeping it from falling off should like to hear it very much first you take an upright stick said the knight </s>
<s> then you make your hair creep up it like fruit tree </s>
<s> now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down things never fall upwards you know </s>
<s> it's plan of my own invention </s>
<s> you may try it if you like it didn't sound comfortable plan alice thought and for few minutes she walked on in silence puzzling over the idea and every now and then stopping to help the poor knight who certainly was not good rider </s>
<s> whenever the horse stopped which it did very often he fell off in front and whenever it went on again which it generally did rather suddenly he fell off behind </s>
<s> otherwise he kept on pretty well except that he had habit of now and then falling off sideways and as he generally did this on the side on which alice was walking she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse </s>
<s> i'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding she ventured to say as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble </s>
<s> the knight looked very much surprised and little offended at the remark </s>
<s> what makes you say that he asked as he scrambled back into the saddle keeping hold of alice's hair with one hand to save himself from falling over on the other side </s>
<s> because people don't fall off quite so often when they've had much practice i've had plenty of practice the knight said very gravely plenty of practice alice could think of nothing better to say than indeed but she said it as heartily as she could </s>
<s> they went on little way in silence after this the knight with his eyes shut muttering to himself and alice watching anxiously for the next tumble </s>
<s> the great art of riding the knight suddenly began in loud voice waving his right arm as he spoke is to keep here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun as the knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where alice was walking </s>
<s> she was quite frightened this time and said in an anxious tone as she picked him up hope no bones are broken none to speak of the knight said as if he didn't mind breaking two or three of them </s>
<s> the great art of riding as was saying is to keep your balance properly </s>
<s> like this you know he let go the bridle and stretched out both his arms to show alice what he meant and this time he fell flat on his back right under the horse's feet </s>
<s> plenty of practice he went on repeating all the time that alice was getting him on his feet again </s>
<s> plenty of practice it's too ridiculous cried alice losing all her patience this time </s>
<s> you ought to have wooden horse on wheels that you ought does that kind go smoothly the knight asked in tone of great interest clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke just in time to save himself from tumbling off again </s>
<s> much more smoothly than live horse alice said with little scream of laughter in spite of all she could do to prevent it </s>
<s> i'll get one the knight said thoughtfully to himself </s>
<s> one or two several there was short silence after this and then the knight went on again </s>
<s> i'm great hand at inventing things </s>
<s> now daresay you noticed that last time you picked me up that was looking rather thoughtful you were little grave said alice </s>
<s> well just then was inventing new way of getting over gate would you like to hear it very much indeed alice said politely </s>
<s> i'll tell you how came to think of it said the knight </s>
<s> you see said to myself the only difficulty is with the feet the head is high enough already now first put my head on the top of the gate then stand on my head then the feet are high enough you see then i'm over you see yes suppose you'd be over when that was done alice said thoughtfully but don't you think it would be rather hard haven't tried it yet the knight said gravely so can't tell for certain but i'm afraid it would be little hard he looked so vexed at the idea that alice changed the subject hastily </s>
<s> what curious helmet you've got she said cheerfully </s>
<s> is that your invention too the knight looked down proudly at his helmet which hung from the saddle </s>
<s> yes he said but i've invented better one than that like sugar loaf </s>
<s> when used to wear it if fell off the horse it always touched the ground directly </s>
<s> so had very little way to fall you see but there was the danger of falling into it to be sure </s>
<s> that happened to me once and the worst of it was before could get out again the other white knight came and put it on </s>
<s> he thought it was his own helmet the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh </s>
<s> i'm afraid you must have hurt him she said in trembling voice being on the top of his head had to kick him of course the knight said very seriously </s>
<s> and then he took the helmet off again but it took hours and hours to get me out </s>
<s> was as fast as as lightning you know but that's different kind of fastness alice objected </s>
<s> the knight shook his head </s>
<s> it was all kinds of fastness with me can assure you he said </s>
<s> he raised his hands in some excitement as he said this and instantly rolled out of the saddle and fell headlong into deep ditch </s>
<s> alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him </s>
<s> she was rather startled by the fall as for some time he had kept on very well and she was afraid that he really was hurt this time </s>
<s> however though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone </s>
<s> all kinds of fastness he repeated but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet on with the man in it too how can you go on talking so quietly head downwards alice asked as she dragged him out by the feet and laid him in heap on the bank </s>
<s> the knight looked surprised at the question </s>
<s> what does it matter where my body happens to be he said </s>
<s> my mind goes on working all the same </s>
<s> in fact the more head downwards am the more keep inventing new things now the cleverest thing of the sort that ever did he went on after pause was inventing new pudding during the meat course in time to have it cooked for the next course said alice </s>
<s> well not the next course the knight said in slow thoughtful tone no certainly not the next course then it would have to be the next day </s>
<s> suppose you wouldn't have two pudding courses in one dinner well not the next day the knight repeated as before not the next day </s>
<s> in fact he went on holding his head down and his voice getting lower and lower don't believe that pudding ever was cooked </s>
<s> in fact don't believe that pudding ever will be cooked </s>
<s> and yet it was very clever pudding to invent what did you mean it to be made of alice asked hoping to cheer him up for the poor knight seemed quite low spirited about it </s>
<s> it began with blotting paper the knight answered with groan </s>
<s> that wouldn't be very nice i'm afraid not very nice alone he interrupted quite eagerly but you've no idea what difference it makes mixing it with other things such as gunpowder and sealing wax </s>
<s> and here must leave you they had just come to the end of the wood </s>
<s> alice could only look puzzled she was thinking of the pudding </s>
<s> you are sad the knight said in an anxious tone let me sing you song to comfort you is it very long alice asked for she had heard good deal of poetry that day </s>
<s> it's long said the knight but very very beautiful </s>
<s> everybody that hears me sing it either it brings the tears into their eyes or else or else what said alice for the knight had made sudden pause </s>
<s> or else it doesn't you know </s>
<s> the name of the song is called haddocks eyes oh that's the name of the song is it alice said trying to feel interested </s>
<s> no you don't understand the knight said looking little vexed </s>
<s> that's what the name is called </s>
<s> the name really is the aged aged man then ought to have said that's what the song is called alice corrected herself </s>
<s> no you oughtn't that's quite another thing </s>
<s> the song is called ways and means but that's only what it's called you know well what is the song then said alice who was by this time completely bewildered </s>
<s> was coming to that the knight said </s>
<s> the song really is sitting on gate and the tune's my own invention so saying he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck then slowly beating time with one hand and with faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face as if he enjoyed the music of his song he began </s>
<s> of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the looking glass this was the one that she always remembered most clearly </s>
<s> years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again as if it had been only yesterday the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the knight the setting sun gleaming through his hair and shining on his armour in blaze of light that quite dazzled her the horse quietly moving about with the reins hanging loose on his neck cropping the grass at her feet and the black shadows of the forest behind all this she took in like picture as with one hand shading her eyes she leant against tree watching the strange pair and listening in half dream to the melancholy music of the song </s>
<s> but the tune isn't his own invention she said to herself it's give thee all can no more she stood and listened very attentively but no tears came into her eyes </s>
<s> i'll tell thee everything can there's little to relate </s>
<s> saw an aged aged man sitting on gate </s>
<s> who are you aged man said and how is it you live and his answer trickled through my head like water through sieve </s>
<s> he said look for butterflies that sleep among the wheat make them into mutton pies and sell them in the street </s>
<s> sell them unto men he said who sail on stormy seas and that's the way get my bread trifle if you please but was thinking of plan to dye one's whiskers green and always use so large fan that they could not be seen </s>
<s> so having no reply to give to what the old man said cried come tell me how you live and thumped him on the head </s>
<s> his accents mild took up the tale he said go my ways and when find mountain rill set it in blaze and thence they make stuff they call rolands macassar oil yet twopence halfpenny is all they give me for my toil but was thinking of way to feed oneself on batter and so go on from day to day getting little fatter </s>
<s> shook him well from side to side until his face was blue come tell me how you live cried and what it is you do he said hunt for haddocks eyes among the heather bright and work them into waistcoat buttons in the silent night </s>
<s> and these do not sell for gold or coin of silvery shine but for copper halfpenny and that will purchase nine </s>
<s> sometimes dig for buttered rolls or set limed twigs for crabs sometimes search the grassy knolls for wheels of hansom cabs </s>
<s> and that's the way he gave wink by which get my wealth and very gladly will drink your honour's noble health heard him then for had just completed my design to keep the menai bridge from rust by boiling it in wine </s>
<s> thanked him much for telling me the way he got his wealth but chiefly for his wish that he might drink my noble health </s>
<s> and now if e'er by chance put my fingers into glue or madly squeeze right hand foot into left hand shoe or if drop upon my toe very heavy weight weep for it reminds me so of that old man used to know whose look was mild whose speech was slow whose hair was whiter than the snow whose face was very like crow with eyes like cinders all aglow who seemed distracted with his woe who rocked his body to and fro and muttered mumblingly and low as if his mouth were full of dough who snorted like buffalo that summer evening long ago sitting on gate as the knight sang the last words of the ballad he gathered up the reins and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had come </s>
<s> you've only few yards to go he said down the hill and over that little brook and then you'll be queen but you'll stay and see me off first he added as alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed </s>
<s> shan't be long </s>
<s> you'll wait and wave your handkerchief when get to that turn in the road </s>
<s> think it'll encourage me you see of course i'll wait said alice and thank you very much for coming so far and for the song liked it very much hope so the knight said doubtfully but you didn't cry so much as thought you would so they shook hands and then the knight rode slowly away into the forest </s>
<s> it won't take long to see him off expect alice said to herself as she stood watching him </s>
<s> there he goes </s>
<s> right on his head as usual </s>
<s> however he gets on again pretty easily that comes of having so many things hung round the horse so she went on talking to herself as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road and the knight tumbling off first on one side and then on the other </s>
<s> after the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn and then she waved her handkerchief to him and waited till he was out of sight </s>
<s> hope it encouraged him she said as she turned to run down the hill and now for the last brook and to be queen </s>
<s> how grand it sounds very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook </s>
<s> the eighth square at last she cried as she bounded across and threw herself down to rest on lawn as soft as moss with little flower beds dotted about it here and there </s>
<s> oh how glad am to get here </s>
<s> and what is this on my head she exclaimed in tone of dismay as she put her hands up to something very heavy and fitted tight all round her head </s>
<s> but how can it have got there without my knowing it she said to herself as she lifted it off and set it on her lap to make out what it could possibly be </s>
<s> it was golden crown </s>
<s> chapter ix </s>
<s> queen alice well this is grand said alice </s>
<s> never expected should be queen so soon and i'll tell you what it is your majesty she went on in severe tone she was always rather fond of scolding herself it'll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that </s>
<s> queens have to be dignified you know so she got up and walked about rather stiffly just at first as she was afraid that the crown might come off but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her and if really am queen she said as she sat down again shall be able to manage it quite well in time everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel bit surprised at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her one on each side she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there but she feared it would not be quite civil </s>
<s> however there would be no harm she thought in asking if the game was over </s>
<s> please would you tell me she began looking timidly at the red queen </s>
<s> speak when you're spoken to the queen sharply interrupted her </s>
<s> but if everybody obeyed that rule said alice who was always ready for little argument and if you only spoke when you were spoken to and the other person always waited for you to begin you see nobody would ever say anything so that ridiculous cried the queen </s>
<s> why don't you see child here she broke off with frown and after thinking for minute suddenly changed the subject of the conversation </s>
<s> what do you mean by if you really are queen </s>
<s> what right have you to call yourself so </s>
<s> you can't be queen you know till you've passed the proper examination </s>
<s> and the sooner we begin it the better only said if poor alice pleaded in piteous tone </s>
<s> the two queens looked at each other and the red queen remarked with little shudder she says she only said if but she said great deal more than that the white queen moaned wringing her hands </s>
<s> oh ever so much more than that so you did you know the red queen said to alice </s>
<s> always speak the truth think before you speak and write it down afterwards i'm sure didn't mean alice was beginning but the red queen interrupted her impatiently </s>
<s> that's just what complain of </s>
<s> you should have meant </s>
<s> what do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning </s>
<s> even joke should have some meaning and child's more important than joke hope </s>
<s> you couldn't deny that even if you tried with both hands don't deny things with my hands alice objected </s>
<s> nobody said you did said the red queen </s>
<s> said you couldn't if you tried she's in that state of mind said the white queen that she wants to deny something only she doesn't know what to deny nasty vicious temper the red queen remarked and then there was an uncomfortable silence for minute or two </s>
<s> the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen invite you to alice's dinner party this afternoon the white queen smiled feebly and said and invite you didn't know was to have party at all said alice but if there is to be one think ought to invite the guests we gave you the opportunity of doing it the red queen remarked but daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet manners are not taught in lessons said alice </s>
<s> lessons teach you to do sums and things of that sort and you do addition the white queen asked </s>
<s> what's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one don't know said alice </s>
<s> lost count she can't do addition the red queen interrupted </s>
<s> can you do subtraction </s>
<s> take nine from eight nine from eight can't you know alice replied very readily but she can't do subtraction said the white queen </s>
<s> can you do division </s>
<s> divide loaf by knife what's the answer to that suppose alice was beginning but the red queen answered for her </s>
<s> bread and butter of course </s>
<s> try another subtraction sum </s>
<s> take bone from dog what remains alice considered </s>
<s> the bone wouldn't remain of course if took it and the dog wouldn't remain it would come to bite me and i'm sure shouldn't remain then you think nothing would remain said the red queen </s>
<s> think that's the answer wrong as usual said the red queen the dog's temper would remain but don't see how why look here the red queen cried </s>
<s> the dog would lose its temper wouldn't it perhaps it would alice replied cautiously </s>
<s> then if the dog went away its temper would remain the queen exclaimed triumphantly </s>
<s> alice said as gravely as she could they might go different ways but she couldn't help thinking to herself what dreadful nonsense we are talking she can't do sums bit the queens said together with great emphasis </s>
<s> can you do sums alice said turning suddenly on the white queen for she didn't like being found fault with so much </s>
<s> the queen gasped and shut her eyes </s>
<s> can do addition if you give me time but can't do subtraction under any circumstances of course you know your said the red queen </s>
<s> to be sure do said alice </s>
<s> so do the white queen whispered we'll often say it over together dear </s>
<s> and i'll tell you secret can read words of one letter </s>
<s> isn't that grand </s>
<s> however don't be discouraged </s>
<s> you'll come to it in time here the red queen began again </s>
<s> can you answer useful questions she said </s>
<s> how is bread made know that alice cried eagerly </s>
<s> you take some flour where do you pick the flower the white queen asked </s>
<s> in garden or in the hedges well it isn't picked at all alice explained it's ground how many acres of ground said the white queen </s>
<s> you mustn't leave out so many things fan her head the red queen anxiously interrupted </s>
<s> she'll be feverish after so much thinking so they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves till she had to beg them to leave off it blew her hair about so </s>
<s> she's all right again now said the red queen </s>
<s> do you know languages </s>
<s> what's the french for fiddle de dee fiddle de dee's not english alice replied gravely </s>
<s> who ever said it was said the red queen </s>
<s> alice thought she saw way out of the difficulty this time </s>
<s> if you'll tell me what language fiddle de dee is i'll tell you the french for it she exclaimed triumphantly </s>
<s> but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly and said queens never make bargains wish queens never asked questions alice thought to herself </s>
<s> don't let us quarrel the white queen said in an anxious tone </s>
<s> what is the cause of lightning the cause of lightning alice said very decidedly for she felt quite certain about this is the thunder no no she hastily corrected herself </s>
<s> meant the other way it's too late to correct it said the red queen when you've once said thing that fixes it and you must take the consequences which reminds me the white queen said looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands we had such thunderstorm last tuesday mean one of the last set of tuesdays you know alice was puzzled </s>
<s> in our country she remarked there's only one day at time the red queen said that's poor thin way of doing things </s>
<s> now here we mostly have days and nights two or three at time and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together for warmth you know are five nights warmer than one night then alice ventured to ask </s>
<s> five times as warm of course but they should be five times as cold by the same rule just so cried the red queen </s>
<s> five times as warm and five times as cold just as i'm five times as rich as you are and five times as clever alice sighed and gave it up </s>
<s> it's exactly like riddle with no answer she thought </s>
<s> humpty dumpty saw it too the white queen went on in low voice more as if she were talking to herself </s>
<s> he came to the door with corkscrew in his hand what did he want said the red queen </s>
<s> he said he would come in the white queen went on because he was looking for hippopotamus </s>
<s> now as it happened there wasn't such thing in the house that morning is there generally alice asked in an astonished tone </s>

<s> it was such thunderstorm you can't think she never could you know said the red queen and part of the roof came off and ever so much thunder got in and it went rolling round the room in great lumps and knocking over the tables and things till was so frightened couldn't remember my own name alice thought to herself never should try to remember my name in the middle of an accident </s>
<s> where would be the use of it but she did not say this aloud for fear of hurting the poor queen's feeling </s>
<s> your majesty must excuse her the red queen said to alice taking one of the white queen's hands in her own and gently stroking it she means well but she can't help saying foolish things as general rule the white queen looked timidly at alice who felt she ought to say something kind but really couldn't think of anything at the moment </s>
<s> she never was really well brought up the red queen went on but it's amazing how good tempered she is </s>

<s> smooth her hair lend her your nightcap and sing her soothing lullaby haven't got nightcap with me said alice as she tried to obey the first direction and don't know any soothing lullabies must do it myself then said the red queen and she began hush by lady in alice's lap </s>

<s> alice knocked and rang in vain for long time but at last very old frog who was sitting under tree got up and hobbled slowly towards her he was dressed in bright yellow and had enormous boots on </s>

<s> which door said the frog </s>
<s> alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke </s>

<s> what did it ask you nothing alice said impatiently </s>
<s> i've been knocking at it shouldn't do that shouldn't do that the frog muttered </s>
<s> vexes it you know then he went up and gave the door kick with one of his great feet </s>

<s> wonder if any one's counting in minute there was silence again and the same shrill voice sang another verse looking glass creatures quoth alice draw near </s>
<s> tis an honour to see me favour to hear tis privilege high to have dinner and tea along with the red queen the white queen and me then came the chorus again then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink or anything else that is pleasant to drink mix sand with the cider and wool with the wine and welcome queen alice with ninety times nine ninety times nine alice repeated in despair oh that'll never be done </s>
<s> i'd better go in at once and there was dead silence the moment she appeared </s>
<s> alice glanced nervously along the table as she walked up the large hall and noticed that there were about fifty guests of all kinds some were animals some birds and there were even few flowers among them </s>
<s> i'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked she thought should never have known who were the right people to invite there were three chairs at the head of the table the red and white queens had already taken two of them but the middle one was empty </s>
<s> alice sat down in it rather uncomfortable in the silence and longing for some one to speak </s>
<s> at last the red queen began </s>
<s> you've missed the soup and fish she said </s>
<s> put on the joint and the waiters set leg of mutton before alice who looked at it rather anxiously as she had never had to carve joint before </s>

<s> may give you slice she said taking up the knife and fork and looking from one queen to the other </s>
<s> certainly not the red queen said very decidedly it isn't etiquette to cut any one you've been introduced to </s>
<s> remove the joint and the waiters carried it off and brought large plum pudding in its place </s>
<s> won't be introduced to the pudding please alice said rather hastily or we shall get no dinner at all </s>
<s> may give you some but the red queen looked sulky and growled pudding alice alice pudding </s>
<s> remove the pudding and the waiters took it away so quickly that alice couldn't return its bow </s>
<s> however she didn't see why the red queen should be the only one to give orders so as an experiment she called out waiter </s>

<s> it was so large that she couldn't help feeling little shy with it as she had been with the mutton however she conquered her shyness by great effort and cut slice and handed it to the red queen </s>
<s> what impertinence said the pudding </s>
<s> wonder how you'd like it if were to cut slice out of you you creature it spoke in thick suety sort of voice and alice hadn't word to say in reply she could only sit and look at it and gasp </s>
<s> make remark said the red queen it's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding do you know i've had such quantity of poetry repeated to me to day alice began little frightened at finding that the moment she opened her lips there was dead silence and all eyes were fixed upon her and it's very curious thing think every poem was about fishes in some way </s>
<s> do you know why they're so fond of fishes all about here she spoke to the red queen whose answer was little wide of the mark </s>
<s> as to fishes she said very slowly and solemnly putting her mouth close to alice's ear her white majesty knows lovely riddle all in poetry all about fishes </s>
<s> shall she repeat it her red majesty's very kind to mention it the white queen murmured into alice's other ear in voice like the cooing of pigeon </s>
<s> it would be such treat </s>
<s> may please do alice said very politely </s>
<s> the white queen laughed with delight and stroked alice's cheek </s>
<s> then she began first the fish must be caught that is easy baby think could have caught it </s>

<s> meanwhile we'll drink your health queen alice's health she screamed at the top of her voice and all the guests began drinking it directly and very queerly they managed it some of them put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers and drank all that trickled down their faces others upset the decanters and drank the wine as it ran off the edges of the table and three of them who looked like kangaroos scrambled into the dish of roast mutton and began eagerly lapping up the gravy just like pigs in trough thought alice </s>

<s> we must support you you know the white queen whispered as alice got up to do it very obediently but little frightened </s>
<s> thank you very much she whispered in reply but can do quite well without that wouldn't be at all the thing the red queen said very decidedly so alice tried to submit to it with good grace </s>

<s> and as for you she went on turning fiercely upon the red queen whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief but the queen was no longer at her side she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of little doll and was now on the table merrily running round and round after her own shawl which was trailing behind her </s>
<s> at any other time alice would have felt surprised at this but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything now </s>

<s> but how can you talk with person if they always say the same thing on this occasion the kitten only purred and it was impossible to guess whether it meant yes or no so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the red queen then she went down on her knees on the hearth rug and put the kitten and the queen to look at each other </s>
<s> now kitty she cried clapping her hands triumphantly </s>
<s> confess that was what you turned into but it wouldn't look at it she said when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister it turned away its head and pretended not to see it but it looked little ashamed of itself so think it must have been the red queen sit up little more stiffly dear alice cried with merry laugh </s>
<s> and curtsey while you're thinking what to what to purr </s>
